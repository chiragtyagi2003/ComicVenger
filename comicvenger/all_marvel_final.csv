In one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative."
"Years after Cap�s plane crash, Howard continues to test on the Tesseract to learn more as part of Project Pegasus created by S.H.I.E.L.D. Over time, a Kree by the name of Mar-Vell somehow infiltrates S.H.I.E.L.D under the name of Dr. Wendy Lawson. She becomes the head of Project Pegasus and relocates the Tesseract to her secret lab in space.

Dr. Wendy continues to work as part of Project Pegasus to create a Light-Speed Engine. She doesn�t approve of her people obliterating the Skrulls (a race of shape-shifters). She wants to hand the Skrulls the Light-Speed Engine so they can escape. She�s also secretly stowed away a bunch of Skrulls in her Space Lab. Before she can complete her work, a Kree squadron, lead by Yon-Rogg, finds her in 1989.

Mar-Vell asks a young pilot, Carol Danvers, to accompany her and the two of them get shot down. This plane has a Jet Engine that Mar-Vell has built, and is powered by the Tesseract. Yon-Rogg kills Mar-Vell. Carol blows up the jet engine. Somehow, she ends up absorbing all the energy from the explosion. Given the closest thing to the Light-Speed Engine has been blown up, Yon-Rogg takes Carol with him as she might be the key to figuring out the Engine. The Kree use Carol�s amnesia to make her believe she is a Kree too. To keep her powers at bay, they put an inhibitor on her. Six years pass.

In one of the missions in 1995, Carol is captured by the Skrulls who are trying to get to the location of the Secret Lab. Long story short, Carol ends up on Earth, runs into a young Nick Fury, finds the lab, remembers her Earth life, realizes the Skrulls are good, gets the Tesseract (which is gobbled by an alien cat), removes her inhibitor, unleashes her full powers, takes down all of the Kree, and set the Skrulls free. The exotic cat scratches Nick Fury�s eye causing him to lose it, and he gets his famous eye patch. Carol gives Nick Fury a pager-on-steroids which he is to use only in case of a vital emergency.The alien cat spits up the Tesseract. This is how S.H.I.E.L.D repossess the Tesseract after it has been in Mar Vell�s secret lab. It technically never left S.H.I.E.L.D, it was always part of Project Pegasus."
"This one is the first of all the Marvel movies. Tony Stark eventually inherits his father�s company. Over the years, Stark Industries has been manufacturing and supplying weapons across the world. Obadiah Stane, a senior personnel in the company, has been illegally trafficking weapons. In one of Tony�s demonstrations of the Jerico missile, he�s captured by terrorists.

In the process, Tony is wounded in the chest by shrapnel shards from the explosion. In the cave, where Tony is kept, is another captive, Dr. Yinsen, who implants an electromagnet into Tony�s chest to keep the shards out of his heart. The terrorists demand that Tony builds them missiles, but Tony and Yinsen build an armored suit powered by an arc reactor. Yinsen sacrifices himself and Tony blows his way out destroying the terrorist camp.

Tony gets found by his friend Colonel James Rhodes and begins work on a more advanced suit powered by a more powerful arc reactor. He also announces that Stark Industries will stop manufacturing weapons which annoys Stane. Tony finds out about Stane and flies off to Afghanistan to blow up the bad guys who have his guns. We�re introduced to Tony�s secretary, Pepper Potts, who hacks into the company�s database to locate all illegal shipments. She also informs S.H.I.E.L.D�s agent Phil Coulson about Stane�s activities. Stane reverse engineers a new suite for himself and steals Tony�s arc leaving him to die. Tony manages to get to his old arc reactor. We then have a final showdown between Tony (who�s now the Iron Man) and Stane. Tony has Pepper overload the giant arc reactor powering his building which causes a surge that consumes Stane. The next day, Tony announces to the world that he is the Iron Man.Nick Fury visits Tony to talk about the Avengers Initiative."
"While not shown in this film, Dr. Bruce Banner is subject to gamma radiations in an experiment gone wrong. As a result, when Bruce is angry, he transforms into the Hulk. In this film, Bruce is lying low in Brazil, working in a bottling plant. But due to a small cut on his hands, his blood happens to get into one of the bottles.This bottle eventually causes a death by gamma poisoning and is traced back to Bruce. General Ross and Emil Blonsky want to weaponize the Hulk and hence try to capture Bruce. But they lose to the Hulk. Blonsky is initially given a small dose of the low-power super-soldier serum, this makes him stronger and gives him healing powers, but he begins losing his mind. After multiple defeats at the hands of the hulk, Blonsky finally gets Banner�s blood injected into him. The combination of the super-soldier serum and the infected gamma blood transforms Blonsky into a mindless beast ? Abomination. The Hulk battles the Abomination and kills him. After this, Bruce stays in British Columbia and slowly learns to turn into the Hulk in a controlled manner.Tony Stark visits General Ross to talk about the Avengers Initiative."
"While the arc reactor, that Tony made, powers his suit, it�s not his invention. Many years back his father, Howard, and a Russian scientist, Anton Vanko, invented it. Anton tried to sell it for profit and is deported back home. Ivan, Anton�s son, happens to see the Iron Man powered by his father arc and wants revenge.Ivan begins building a mini arc reactor based weapon. At a Grand Prix, Ivan attacks Tony who uses his portable suit to become Iron Man and defeats Ivan. Seeing this event, Justin Hammer, a Start Industry rival, stages Ivan�s death and gets him to build armored suits. Tony�s arc reactor uses a Palladium core, and this is slowly poisoning him and will kill him soon. As a result, Tony makes Pepper the CEO of his company and gets a new assistant, Natasha. This is Agent Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), undercover, who is assessing Tony.Nick Fury meets Tony and says that he knew Howard Stark back in the day and hands Tony some of Howard�s old material. In the 3-D hologram, Tony discovers a piece of hidden information for a new element ? it�s fair to assume that Howard Stark found this by experimenting with the Tesseract that hosts the Space Stone. Tony synthesizes this element with the help of his computer J.A.R.V.I.S. This new element removes the need for Palladium. Meanwhile, Ivan takes remote control of all of Justin�s drones and wreaks havoc. Rhodes and Iron Man fight them off and defeat Ivan, who detonates the drones and himself.Agent Phil Coulson, from S.H.I.E.L.D, reports that a massive hammer has been discovered at the bottom of a crater in New Mexico. Yes, Thor�s hammer."
"Thor is the son of Odin (king of Asgard) and an arrogant God. Loki is this brother. For rupturing the truce between Asgard and Jotunheim, Odin exiles Thor to Earth after stripping him off all the Godly powers. Thor�s hammer, the source of his power, is enchanted such that only the worthy can wield it. Thor gets separated from his hammer. While the hammer is found by S.H.I.E.L.D, Thor is found by Dr. Jane Foster and Dr. Erik Selvig.Thor manages to get to the hammer but is unable to lift it because he�s not worthy. Back in Asgard, Loki finds out that he�s adopted. While Odin enters his deep slumber, Loki takes over the throne. Thor�s friends don�t like this and convince the gatekeeper of the Bifr?st (rainbow bridge transportation thingy), Heimdall, to send them to Earth. Loki gets to know of this and sends the Destroyer (an indestructible metallic being thingy) to Earth to kill Thor.The Destroyer defeats Thor�s friends, but he offers himself as a sacrifice and is struck. Because of his worthy actions, Thor�s hammer returns to him. Thor destroys the Destroyer and heads back to Asgard to confront Loki. The two of them fight, and Thor blows up the Bifr?st bridge so that no one can enter Asgard and invade it. Odin awakens and stops Thor and Loki from falling into the emptiness under the bridge. Loki commits suicide by letting himself fall off (no he doesn�t die, he returns in The Avengers). Thor and Odin reconcile, but Thor is stuck on Asgard. Back on Earth, Jane is looking for a way to get to Thor.Nick Fury brings Dr. Selvig to see the Tesseract and says he would like him to take over Project Pegasus. By now, Loki has figured out that the Tesseract is with S.H.I.E.L.D and has taken control of Dr. Selvig�s mind. We can see Loki urging Selvig to agree, and he does. Now, though the scene appears at the end, this event happens right in the middle of the film."
"This one was the first multi-starrer after all the previous Marvel movies. Loki, who faked his death, makes a deal with the leader of a race called Chitauri. Loki is offered an army in exchange for the Tesseract (Space Stone) that�s on Earth. It�s important to know that Thanos is the one who�s firing the shots here. Via the Chitauri, Thanos has given Loki a mighty Sceptre to aid him in the mission of getting the Tesseract. This Sceptre contains the Mind Stone, but no one knows about this but Thanos. Loki is able to control minds using the Sceptre.The film begins with Loki taking over Dr. Selvig and Hawk-Eye�s minds and stealing the Tesseract from Nick Fury. Natasha goes to India looking for Bruce Banner because the Tesseract is giving out gamma radiations which she�s hoping Bruce can trace. Long story short, Loki uses the Tesseract to open a portal and the Chitauri attack. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawk-Eye, and Natasha team together as the Avengers and fight off the aliens. Leaders of Earth decide the best way to end the invasion is to blow up New York and launch a nuke. Iron Man deflects this missile through the worm-hole and blows up the Chitauri mothership. Dr. Selvig and Natasha use the Sceptre to close the portal (one Infinity Stone vs. another, but no one knows about these stones yet). Iron Man falls back through the closing portal just in time, and Hulk grabs him midway. Thor takes Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard. The Scepter is confiscated by S.H.I.E.L.D.We�re shown the leader of the Chitauri telling Thanos that they failed to conquer Earth. Thanos smiles meaning to say �challenge accepted�"
"Since the episode of the alien invasion in Avengers, Tony has been having panic attacks. Aldrich Killian, once a disabled scientist who was rejected by Tony for an idea around healing crippling injuries, is the villain in this film. Aldrich�s treatment, called Extremis, is unstable.While Extremis temporarily cures the subject, it also causes them to explode eventually. To cover up these explosions, Aldrich creates a terrorist by the name Mandarin and gives it the face of an aspiring British actor. He makes it appear like Mandarin has been blowing up stuff.Long story short, Aldrich blows up Tony�s home, kidnaps Pepper, injects her with Extremis so that Tony would be forced to fix the flaw, gets into a brawl with everybody, has a showdown with the Iron Man and finally gets blown up by a super-powered Pepper. Tony stabilizes the effects of Extremis inside of Pepper Pots. Now, she will not explode, but it�s not mentioned if she has retained any of her superpowers.We see Tony Stark trying to get therapy from Bruce Banner who is nodding off and says, �I�m not that kind of a doctor�."
"When the universe was dark, a race called the Dark Elves ruled. Then came the Light, and they lost their power. Malekith, the ruler of the Dark Elves, wants to use the Aether (Reality Stone) and throw the world back into darkness. Now, there is an event that aligns all the nine realms together once every 5000 years. It� s called Convergence.Malekith tries to use the Aether to darken the world in a previous convergence, but is stopped by Thor�s granddad. Hence Malekith puts himself and few other Dark Elves in a state of hibernation. In the present day, as the next convergence approaches, portals begin to randomly appear in the 9 realms.Jane goes to investigate one such portal and gets sucked into the realm where the Aether has been kept hidden from Malekith. Jane activates the Aether by mistake, and it enters her. This awakens Malekith and the other hibernating Dark Elves. The Aether begins to kill Jane because of its power. Long story short ? Thor takes Jane to Asgard, Malekith attacks Asgard to get Jane, Thor�s mother dies protecting Jane, Loki joins forces with Thor to avenge his mother, Loki tricks Malekith by bringing Thor and Jane as his prisoners, Malekith extracts the Aether from Jane, Loki dies (no he doesn�t, Loki is faking it again, he�ll be back in the end), Thor and Malekith fight through the various portals, Thor finally kills Malekith. In the end, Loki is posing as Odin and ruling Asgard. The real Odin is on Earth, we�ll get to that in Ragnarok.We�re shown the Asgardians giving the Aether to a person called the Collector stating that it�s not a good idea to keep two Infinity Stones so close to each other. The Asgardians are already holding the Tesseract (Space Stone) in their protection."
"This film is about the return of Bucky, Cap�s old friend. After he falls off the train (in the first Captain America film), he�s captured by Hydra and is brain-washed and is given instructions to take down S.H.I.E.L.D. We also learn that S.H.I.E.L.D has been infiltrated by Hydra right from its inception.

The present executive in S.H.I.E.L.D who is a Hydra operative is Alexander Pierce. Hydra is using three S.H.I.E.L.D helicarriers to predict potential threats to Hydra and plans to eliminate them. Nick, Natasha, Captain America and Falcon (Sam Wilson) join forces to stop Hydra and the Winter Soldier.

Cap is able to use electronic chips to override all the helicarriers. He fights Bucky but doesn�t want to kill him. The override causes the helicarriers to fire at each other, and they crash. Cap falls into the river below. Bucky pulls Cap out of the river before running into the woods, indicating that the Hydra mind-control is wearing off.The Sceptre, which is with S.H.I.E.L.D, has been extracted by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker who is a Hydra agent. This is a result of S.H.I.E.L.D being infiltrated by Hydra. The Sceptre�s powers have been used to create mutants for Hydra�s usage ? Peter (with super speed) and Wanda (with telekinesis)."
"This film is about Quill�s Daddy Issues. We learn that a Celestial being called Ego plans on terraforming countless planets to extend his own consciousness. He�s been going around impregnating women from various worlds to give birth to an offspring who would hopefully be able to wield the celestial powers.

Ego has also planted seedlings on each of the planets, but the terraformation can be initiated only by two celestials. Ego had hired Yondu to fetch the various offsprings to check if they could access the celestial powers. Given that none of them could do so, he�s been killing them off. One such planet is Earth, and one such offspring is Quill. Yondu realizes Ego�s plan and saves Quill by not delivering him.

Long story short, Quill displays the ability to access the celestial power, bonds with his dad, realizes his dad is evil and resulted in his mother�s death, fights his dad with the help of the other Guardians of the Galaxy, and kills Ego. Yondu sacrifices himself to protect Quill who realizes that his real dad was indeed Yondu. Gamora and Nebula fight as usual but make peace in the end. Nebula vows to kill Thanos and sets off on her own path. Ego�s empath, Mantis, joins the Guardians as they set out in search of new adventures."
"The Avengers retrieve the Sceptre (Mind Stone) from Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. Tony and Bruce use the Mind Stone to develop an A.I driven program called Ultron which is a planned means for global defense. Ultron goes rogue and tries to destroy J.A.R.V.I.S and infiltrates Tony�s robots.Ultron believes that humans need to be eradicated for the protection of the planet. He escapes with the Sceptre and heads to Strucker�s headquarters and builds himself a new body. Ultron meets Peter and Wanda (the mutants that Strucker created using the Scepter) and takes them on to his side by feeding them stories about how Tony Stark�s weapons killed their parents.The Avengers attack Ultron but have their asses handed to them by Wanda�s hallucinations and are forced to retreat. Ultron meets with Ulysses Klaue, an arms dealer who has access to Vibranium from a place called Wakanda. Ultron forges a new body which is part-synthetic, part-Vibraniam and is powered by the Mind Stone. Just as Ultron uploads himself into this new body, Wanda reads his intentions and realizes that Ultron plans for human extinction. She helps the Avengers procure the synthetic body. Tony finds J.A.R.V.I.S who was in hiding within the Internet and secretly uploads him into the body. Thus is born Vision. Ultron uses all the Vibranium to lift up an entire city and plans to drop it causing a global effect like a meteorite would and eradicate everything but metal (robots). Long story short, the Avengers with the help of Peter, Wanda and Vision, stop Ultron. Hulk, not wanting to endanger people of Earth, uses Ultron�s jet and takes off someplace unknown (he�ll be back in Ragnarok).Thanos wears the Infinity Gauntlet and decides that he�s going to personally collect each of the Infinity Stones and take matters into his own hands. Thanos will return in Infinity War."
"This one has certain uniqueness compared to all the Marvel movies. Hank Pym is a scientist who�s the inventor of the Pym Particle ? the thing that can alter the size of objects. He resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D because he doesn�t want it falling into the wrong hands.Hank builds the Ant-Man suit which allows him to shrink down to the size of an ant but gain strength in inverse proportion. Basically the smaller you get, the more powerful you become. He also devises a way to mentally communicate with ants. Hank�s wife, Janet, used to operate using the Wasp suit. In one of their missions, Hank and Janet are trying to disarm a nuclear missile which they can�t get inside. Janet decides to enter the rocket by shrinking down to subatomic size and gets lost in subatomic space.In the present day, an evil man by the name of Darren Cross is building a replica of the Ant-Man suit, called the Yellow Jacket, and wants to sell it to Hydra. Long story short, Hank and his daughter, Hope, recruit a dude named Scott who dawns the suit to become Ant-Man and stops Cross. Ant-Man goes into the subatomic state to sabotage Cross� suit and kills him. However, unlike Janet, he�s able to use the enlarger to get himself back to his actual size.Hank gifts Hope with an advanced version of the Wasp suit (formerly her mother�s ). During the film, Ant-Man & Falcon, have a small run in and based on that, Falcon tells Captain America that they have a possible member for their team. This bit pertains to Civil War."
"This one is the first�epic�film in all the Marvel movies. When Bucky was under the Hydra Mind Control, he was given the assignment to kill Howard Stark and his wife. Bucky kills Tony�s parents. At some point in time after the Winter Soldier movie, Cap gets to know but keeps it a secret from Tony.In the current day, the UN feels that the Avengers have become way too powerful and they need to be �governed�. That the events that involve the Avengers cause way too many casualties. Tony is ridden with guilt and agrees to sign up with this. Natasha, Vision, and Rhodes are with Tony whereas Captain America, Falcon, Hawk-Eye, and Wanda are against it.Enter Zemo, a guy who has lost his family in the Ultron incident. He wants revenge and understands that there is no point in fighting the Avengers. Instead, he gets his hands on the information that Bucky assassinated Tony�s parents and plans to use this to turn Iron Man against Cap. Zemo tracks down the document that contains the trigger words to activate Bucky�s brainwashing. We are then introduced to T�Challa who appears with his father, T�Chaka, king of Wakanda, at the UN signing. Zemo instructs Bucky to bomb this meeting, and T�Chaka is killed. T�Challa (secretly the Black Panther) seeks revenge and joins Team Iron Man. Tony also gets Spider-Man to join him. Cap retrieves Bucky who�s temporarily free of the Mind Control.

"This one is culturally the most unique film in all Marvel movies. In this film, we are shown that a meteorite hit a place in Africa thousands of years ago. This meteorite contained the metal Vibranium (the one Cap�s shield is made from). One warrior eats a heart-shaped herb affected by the metal and gains super-human strength. Thus is formed the kingdom of Wakanda under the leadership of this warrior.

Over generations, they use the Vibranium to become highly advanced but remain hidden. When T�Challa is a young boy, his uncle begins dealing with Ulysses Klaue and supplying him Vibranium; now we know how Klaue provided Ultron with the metal. The uncle wants to empower all the people from Africa across the world with weapons to rise against their oppressors. T�Challa�s father kills his brother and abandons his brother�s child, Erik, to grow up as an orphan. Erik (Killmonger) learns about the real Wakanda from his father�s journals and eventually joins the black-ops.

After the events of Civil War, T�Challa returns to Wakanda to become king. He faces M�Baku in ritualistic combat to the death and defeats him but doesn�t kill him. Erik initially appears to be working with Klaue. A CIA agent, Everett, gets involved and is severely wounded while trying to arrest Klaue. T�Challa decides to take Everett back to Wakanda to save his life. Erik kills Klaue, shows up in Wakanda, and announces who he is. He challenges T�Challa and defeats him, throws him over a waterfall, and becomes king. He also consumes the herb to turn super-powered. Erik picks up where his father left off and commissions jets to fly out Vibranium to dealers in America. T�Challa is saved by M�Baku as a repayment. T�Challa�s family revive him by giving him the last of the heart-shaped-herb. In a final showdown with the Black Panther, Erik is killed. Everett remote pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the Vibranium. After this, T�Challa announces at the UN the truth about Wakanda.T�Challa�s sister, Shuri, is working on getting Bucky free of his brainwashing."
"This one is the first solo for Spidey in all the Marvel movies. After the Chitauri�s invasion in Avengers, a man named Toomes is hired to clear the city. But Tony�s company takes over the operation, and Toomes is left without a job. He uses the Chitauri tech to build new weapons and a suit for himself; Toomes is the Vulture. After the fight at the airport in Civil War, Peter resumes school but focuses on crime-fighting with his new Spider-Suit from Tony.Peter is reckless and takes on the Vulture endangering himself and civilians. Tony takes away the Spider-Suit. Eventually, Spider-Man and Vulture learn of each other�s true identities.

"This has got to be visually the most exciting in all the Marvel movies. Doctor Stephan Strange is an arrogant neurosurgeon whose hands get damaged in a car accident. Unable to perform any operations Dr. Strange begins searching various options to get better. He stumbles upon a paraplegic who mysteriously regained the use of his legs. This leads him to Nepal where he meets the Ancient One (an aged sorcerer) and Mordo (a fellow sorcerer). Dr. Strange learns that sorcerer Kaecilius and his men stole some ancient mystical text to open a portal to the Dark Dimension.Dr. Strange trains under the Ancient One and learns quickly. He also learns how to use the Eye Of Agamotto (Time Stone) to bend time. In a fight against Kaecilius, the Ancient One gets fatally wounded and dies. Dr. Strange, Mordo and Wong (the keeper of the books) are left to stop Kaecilius by themselves. Dr. Strange enters the Dark Dimension to face Dormammu (the ruler) and creates a time loop around himself. Dormammu repeatedly kills Dr. Strange only to realize he�s stuck in an endless loop. He agrees to leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his men with him. The Earth is safe.Dr. Strange has a chat with Thor who states that he and Loki are on Earth looking for their father, Odin. Dr. Strange agrees to help. Mordo walks up to the paraplegic man and steals his power claiming that the world has too many sorcerers."
"Because of Scott using the Ant-Man suit to team up with Captain America in the Civil War movie, Scott is placed under house arrest. Remember Ant-Man goes into subatomic space in the first movie? Because of that he gets into a quantum entanglement with Janet and can see her memories. Scott reaches out to Hank and Hope telling them about his visions. They confirm that Janet is alive and plan to go into the subatomic space to retrieve her.We�re introduced to Ava Starr, who is the daughter of Hank�s old partner. During an experiment that goes wrong, Ava�s parents are killed, and she�s left in an unstable ghost state. Bill Foster, yet another old partner of Hank, has been helping Ava and plans to draw on Janet�s energy to stabilize her. Hank believes this might kill Janet and this leads to a feud. In the end, Hank is able to retrieve Janet from the subatomic space. She uses her energy to stabilize Ava. Scott sneaks back into his home just in time and is released from his house arrest.In the flow of the films, this scene pertains to the event from Infinity War. We�ll get back to this later."
"This one is the funniest of all the Marvel movies. The film begins with Surtur, the fire demon, who has captured Thor. Thor learns about Odin not being on Asgard and the prophecy of Ragnarok that will allow Surtur to destroy Asgard. Thor steals Surtur�s crown, the source of his power, and returns to Asgard. He exposes Loki who has been posing as Odin and takes him to Earth to look for the real Odin.

With the help of Dr. Strange, they find Odin in Norway. Odin explains to them that he�s dying and his death will free their sister, Hela, the Goddess of death, who he has kept imprisoned. As promised, Odin dies, Hela emerges and destroys Thor�s hammer. Loki and Thor try to get back to Asgard using the Bifr?st, but they are interrupted by Hela who throws them into outer space and the two of them land on the planet Sakaar.

While Loki somehow happens to make friends with the Grandmaster (ruler of Sakaar), Thor is taken prisoner by a slave trader and is sold as a Gladiator. Now, remember Hulk takes the jet and leaves Earth after beating up Ultron? He happened to wander into Sakaar and has not turned back into Bruce ever since. Thor meets Hulk on the battlefield but is subdued because of an inhibitor chip on his neck. The slave trader, 142, happens to be an ex-member of the Valkyrior, who once battled Hela. Thor teams up with 142, and Hulk and heads to Asgard to take on Hela. He realizes that she�s way too powerful and asks Loki to fetch Surtur�s crown. Loki gets the crown but also steals the Tesseract (Space-Stone) from the vault. Surtur is reborn and fulfills the prophecy of Ragnarok and destroys Asgard while killing Hela.The remaining survivors of Asgard onboard a spaceship and head to Earth but are intercepted by Thanos.

"
"This one is the highest point of �all-stars� in all the Marvel movies. Thanos, a mighty Titan, has a simple solution to over-population ? randomly kill half the universe so the survivors will have a better chance of .. well, surviving. For this, he needs to collect all six infinity stones, put it on his infinity gauntlet, and snap his fingers.

Before the film begins, Thanos has already gotten the Power Stone from the Nova Corps in Xandar. He beats up Thor, Hulk and kills Loki and takes the Space Stone from the Tesseract. Heimdal, the keeper of the Bifr?st, teleports Hulk to Earth before getting killed. Hulk transforms back to Bruce and is unable to go back to being Hulk. Bruce warns Dr. Strange who contacts Tony.

Thanos� henchmen land up on Earth to get the Time Stone. The battle leads Dr. Strange, Iron-Man and Spider-Man to get on the henchmen�s Space Ship. Bruce contacts Cap. Wanda and Vision are attacked by another set of henchmen. Cap, Natasha, and Falcon come to their aid. They head to Wakanda to figure a way to separate the Mind Stone from Vision�s head.

The Guardians rescue Thor who tells them that Thanos will head to Knowhere to get the Reality Stone from the Collector. Groot, Rocket and Thor head to Nidavellir to get a new Axe forged from a giant dwarf.

Quill, Drax, Gamora and Mantis head to Knowhere only to realize that Thanos has already taken the Reality Stone. He also kidnaps Gamora and has already captured Nebula. To save Nebula from torture, Gamora reveals the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos and Gamora head to Vormir, where the Soul Stone is, and meet with Red Skull (remember the guy who got sucked in through a wormhole in Captain America?). The Soul Stone needs a sacrifice, and Thanos kills Gamora to procure it.

Nebula escapes and teams with the remaining Guardians and heads to Titan. Here, Nebula, Mantis, Drax, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, and Dr.Strange try to get Thano�s gauntlet off. But Quill interferes after learning that Gamora is dead. As a result, Thanos defeats everyone and Dr. Strange hands over the Time Stone in exchange for Iron-Man�s life.

At Wakanda, Black Panther and friends, Bucky, Captain America, Rhodes, Natasha, Bruce, Falcon, and Wanda fight off Thanos� henchmen. Shuri tries to separate the Mind Stone from Vision but is unable to. Groot, Rocket, and Thor (with his new Axe) arrive at Wakanda to help. Thanos finally arrives and beats everyone up. Wanda destroys the Mind Stone and kills Vision. But Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse time and rips the Mind Stone out of Vision. Thor comes landing his Axe into Thanos� chest, but Thanos snaps his gauntleted fingers. As promised, half the population of the universe is instantly killed.

On Titan, Iron-Man and Nebula are left alive while Quill, Drax, Mantis, Spider-Man and Dr. Strange die. And in Wakanda, Bruce, Rhodes, Rocket, Cap, Natasha, Thor, and a few Wakandans remain alive while Blank Panther, Bucky, Groot, Wanda, and Falcon die.  We are shown Nick Fury, and Maria Hill die, but Nick uses his pager-on-steroids just in time to warn Captain Marvel. Coming back to the Ant-Man and the Wasp�s post-credit scene, we�re shown that Hank, Janet, and Hope die while Scott is left alive. And coming back to Captain Marvel�s post-credit scene, she lands up on Earth asking for Nick Fury."
"This one is the most�epic�of all the Marvel moves. After Infinity War, the remaining Avengers find Thanos but he has already destroyed the stones. Thor kills him. 5 years later, Scott, who is stuck in the quantum realm, gets tossed out because of a rat snooping around the truck. While it was just a few seconds for him, 5 years pass for the rest. Scott suggests the idea of time-travel.The remaining Avengers get together and plot an elaborate time-heist using the Pym particles Scott has access to. They go to multiple dates in the past to spawn new timelines. They temporarily borrow Infinity Stones from these timelines and successfully un-snap and bring all the dusted people back.Unfortunately, another Thanos from one of the timelines learns about this future and makes his way with an army to wipe all living beings by getting his hands on the stones. An epic battle ensues, and Tony gives his life by snapping and dusting Thanos and his entire army.�After this, Steve goes on a journey to return the Infinity Stones to their rightful timelines and finally makes a journey to the past to create one final timeline. Here, he lives his whole life happily with Peggy and returns as an old man to give his shield to The Falcon.The time-travel in the film caused a lot of confusion."
"A short while after the events of Avengers: Endgame, a person named Beck, who was once a STARK employee and holographic-illusions specialist, is looking to take control of Tony�s orbital weapon supply powered by a pair of glasses. Using drones and carefully projected holograms, Beck takes on the role of Mysterio, a super-human from a parallel universe, fighting enemies called the Elementals.

First, Beck stages a fight in Mexico with the Earth Elemental. Nick Fury and Maria Hill take notice and reach out to Beck. Next, he stages a battle with the Water Elemental in Italy. Peter, who happens to be part of a school trip, witnesses this fight and helps protect his classmates.

Fury hands Peter Tony�s glasses powered by the AI, EDITH, which gives him access to Stark�s orbital weapon supply. When Peter and Beck meet, Beck feeds him lies about a multiverse. Avoiding his superhero duties, Peter hands Tony�s glasses to Beck and transfers control. Beck uses the orbital weapon to wreak havoc with the more elaborate holograms. MJ discloses that she knows Peter is Spider-Man, and the two stumble upon a drone of Beck�s that makes them realize that Beck was bluffing. In a final fight, Peter takes down Beck. Peter�s spider-sense saves him from a missile which instead hits Beck and kills him.Beck pre-records a message disclosing to the world Peter Parker is Spider-Man and sends it over to J. Jonah Jameson. This is aired, and Peter watches on in horror.Nick Future and Maria Hill are actually Talos and Soren in disguise following orders from the real Nick Fury who is in outer space, flying the Skrull ship."
"Post Endgame, this one is most unique of all the Marvel movies. A thousand years back, Xu Wenwu came to possess the all-powerful ten rings and formed his shadowy organization called the Ten Rings, which helped topple kingdoms and governments. Wenwu is on the hunt for Ta Lo but is stopped by a guardian called Ying Li, and the two fall in love and have two kids ? Shang-Chi and Xialing.

Wenwu locks away his ten rings, and for a while, it was good. Eventually, his enemies come seeking revenge and kill Ying Li, which is witnessed by a young Shang-Chi. Wenwu reinstates the Ten Rings and instructs Shang-Chi to kill his mother�s murderer. Shang-Chi kills but doesn�t want to be caught up in this life of murder and abandons his little sister and makes a run for it.

The main events take place after Endgame. Shang-Chi now lives in San Fransisco, working with his friend Katy as a parking valet. He gets attacked, and the assailants take the pendant his mother once gave him. Shang-Chi and Katy go to Macau to meet Xialing and are rounded up by Wenwu, who explains that Ying Li has been talking to him and that she�s being held prisoner in Ta Lo. But in reality, the voices are coming from an imprisoned beast called Dweller-in-Darkness.

Everyone lands up in Ta Lo for the climax, and we are introduced to Ying Li�s sister Ying Nan. Wenwu is tricked into freeing the beast, which claims his soul. The Ten Rings and the Ta Lo warriors unite and take down the beast with the help of Katy and Shang-Chi, who now controls the rings. Katy and Shang-Chi head back to San Fransisco, and the film ends with Wong taking them to Kamar-Taj.Bruce Banner and Captain Marvel meet Shang-Chi and Kate, to discuss the origin of the rings. They figure that the rings are signalling out to something unidentified.Xialing is now the leader of the Ten Rings and has both men and women training together, something that was forbidden earlier."
"This story dates back to before the creation of the Infinity Stones. Cosmic beings called Celestials create stars and bring light to the universe. From the darkness, there came Deviants that kill intelligent life on planets. The Celestial Arishem sends a group of superpowered beings called Eternals to Earth in 5000BC to protect humans from Deviants. The Eternals succeed in eradicating all the Deviants by the 1500s, or so they think. A bunch of Deviants get preserved in ice.

The Eternals live their lives on Earth, waiting for a message from Arishem stating their mission is complete. Hundreds of years pass, and in the present day, the Eternals come to know that Earth is one of many host planets for the seed of a Celestial. Once the intelligent life reaches a particular threshold, the Celestial will emerge from the core, and the planet will be destroyed.

Arishem later reveals that he created the Deviants to eliminate apex predators from planets so that intelligent life could develop. But Deviants evolved and began destroying all life. To stop them, Arishem created the Eternals to kill Deviants. After each emergence, the memories of Eternals are wiped clean, and they are assigned another planet.

Deviants get free from the ice and attack the Eternals and absorb their powers. Ikaris turns against the Eternals, who plan to kill the Celestial, but is unable to stop Sersi as he loves her. In the end, the surviving Eternals form a Uni-Mind and freeze and kill the emerging Celestial.  Eros (Thanos� brother), a.k.a Starfox, enters the Domo with Pip The Troll, and they offer to help find Sersi, Kingo and Phastos.Sersi�s boyfriend, Dane, is about to pick up a cursed ancestral sword called the Ebony Blade. Once he does, he will become the Black Knight, but Dane is stopped by a voice that asks, �Sure you�re ready for that, Mr Whitman?�. This person is Blade, once portrayed by Wesley Snipes back in the 90s."
"In the past, Thor requests Mjolnir to take care of Jane in her time of need. In the present day, Jane is dying from cancer and is beckoned by the hammer. Because she�s worthy enough, she commands the power of Thor.

A person named Gorr is chosen by Necrosword, and he seeks revenge for his daughter�s death by killing every god. He kidnaps the Asgardian children to lure Thor and take the Stormbreaker, which is the key to reaching Eternity, a cosmic being that can grant any wish (oddly, something Thanos was unaware of).

Quill is chilling on Earth with his grandfather, who�s reading the newspaper with the headlines saying Kevin Bacon was kidnapped ? this refers to The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special."
"This one is the most tragic of all the Marvel movies. The story is set a year after T�Challa�s death when a student named Riri invents a Vibranium finder, and the US government gets its hands on it. Unfortunately, they use the machine to trace the hidden kingdom of Talokan, ruled by one called Namor. He wants to kill Riri to protect his kingdom, whereas Wakanda takes Riri into their protective custody.

Riri returns to college, Okoye frees Ross, and M�Baku challenges for the throne.Nakia reveals to Shuri that she had a son with T�Challa, Toussaint."
"This one is the most nostalgic of all the Marvel movies. For the detailed analysis, see this ? Spider-Man: No Way Home Explained

After Mysterio reveals Peter�s identity, life becomes miserable for him, Ned and MJ. Peter seeks the help of Dr Strange to make everyone forget his identity. But Peter�s intrusions mess the spell up, causing entities from other parallel universes who know their Spider-Man�s identity to attack the wrong Peter Parker.

While Peter works with Strange to return these people to their home universes, Aunt May says that it is their responsibility to help these villains as they are merely broken individuals. Peter agrees and stops Strange from returning The Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Sandman, The Lizard and Electro and tries to fix them with the help of Stark tech. Only Doc Ock�s chip is successfully replaced and it all backfires when Goblin provokes the rest and flees after killing Aunt May. 

The most iconic moments in comic films history happens when the other two Spider-Men come to the aid of Peter, and the three team up to take down and fix the bad guys. Strange says the spell is uncontainable, and far too many intruders from other universes start encroaching. Peter asks Strange to make everyone forget him, which stops the convergence of the multiverse. The Spider-Men bid goodbye and Peter Parker begins a new life where no one knows him, and he swings away into the night. We see Venom (Tom Hardy) drinking and learning about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how Thanos dusted half the population. After that, he goes back to his own universe.This is a full-blown intro to Dr Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness with Wanda and Kang in the mix. In the end, we also see an evil Strange who appears to be one of the main upcoming antagonists."
"This is the only one with a tinge of horror in all the Marvel movies. Wanda becomes obsessed with the kids she conjures up in the series WandaVision. Unable to deal with her grief of losing Vision, she turns to the book of the damned, Darkhold. She wants the powers of America Chavez, a girl who can travel across multiverses.

Wanda�s plan is to replace herself in another universe where her kids, Billy and Tommy, are real. The film does not explain who the father could be as we all know it�s not Vision. Chavez initially takes the help of another Strange, who gets killed, and she makes her way into the Prime MCU. Strange learns that Wanda is now the Scarlet Witch and tries to protect Chavez with Wong�s help. Chavez and Strange land in another universe and are captured by the Illuminati, headed by Mordo, Black Bolt, Mr Fantastic, Captain Carter (Peggy), and Captain Marvel (Maria). Wanda dreamwalks into this universe via her alter ego and kills the Illuminati. The alternate Christine helps Strange find the Book of Vishanti, which is useless.

Strange kills and steals a Darkhold from another Strange, in another universe, possesses the dead Strange and tries to stop Wanda. It all fails, and finally, Chavez opens a portal to show how Billy and Tommy fear Wanda, the Witch. Wanda destroys the Darkhold in all universes and kills herself. The film ends with Strange gaining the third eye.Clea, also a sorceress and possible love interest, takes Strange with her to help save another universe.Bruce Campbell�s pizza-ball cameo appearance returns to say, �it�s over�."
"The Avengers Initiative was the brainchild of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. He first approached Tony Stark with the idea, following Tony�s defeat of Obadiah Stane and his subsequent public announcement that he was Iron Man. Fury kept his eye on several potential members, as Bruce Banner struggled with life as the Hulk, the Asgardian Thor appeared on Earth, and Steve Rogers, AKA World War II hero Captain America, was discovered alive decades after his apparent death. In the meantime, some of S.H.I.E.L.D.�s most skilled members, Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye (Clint Barton), were making a name for themselves and impressing Fury.

Once the Asgardian trickster god Loki arrived on Earth and absconded with the massively powerful object known as the Tesseract�possessing Hawkeye and turning him into his brainwashed pawn in the process�Fury found it necessary to finally bring together his potential super team, calling in Romanoff, Banner, Rogers and Stark. Captain America and Iron Man, assisted by Black Widow, were able to capture Loki, but during their flight back to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor arrived, attempting to bring his brother back to Asgard to face justice. A fight ensued between Thor and Iron Man, but Captain America broke it up, and the group all returned with their prisoner, Loki, to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier."
"While Stark and Banner found some common ground through their love of science, the would-be team were at odds as they discussed their next course of action, and arguments escalated in the wake of discovering that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been using the Tesseract to recreate dangerous HYDRA weapons.

Loki revealed that it was his plan to be captured all along and triggered Banner to turn into the Hulk. While engaging in a fight with Thor, Hulk nearly destroyed the Helicarrier, before crashing down to Earth. Escaping in the chaos, Loki then ejected Thor from the Helicarrier in his own enclosed cell and retrieved his scepter, killing Phil Coulson with it. Black Widow fought Hawkeye, who had arrived to help Loki, managing to bring her friend back to his true self in the process. Loki continued on to New York where, with the help of the brainwashed Dr. Erik Selvig, he opened a portal into space, unleashing a devastating Chitauri army.

Motivated by the tragic death of Phil Coulson, Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, and Hawkeye all headed to New York to fight Loki and his invading Chitauri forces, and were soon joined again by Thor and Hulk, with the six heroes truly assembling as the Avengers for the first time."
"While brought together thanks to a long-term plan by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the Avengers operate independently upon their formation, working with S.H.I.E.L.D., but not answering to them or any other government agency. In the wake of the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by HYDRA, the Avengers arguably become even more independent, as Tony Stark continues to provide them with their equipment, resources, and staff. The team also relocates from Avengers Tower (originally Stark Tower) in Manhattan to a Stark-owned facility in upstate New York.

Following devastation wrought by the Super Villain Ultron, the Avengers add more members to its roster, including Sam Wilson AKA Falcon, Wanda Maximoff AKA Scarlet Witch, the android Vision, and James Rhodes AKA War Machine.

"
"The Sokovia Accords call for the Avengers to begin answering to the United Nations, who would have a say in what missions they undertake and which parts of the world they could operate in. Under Iron Man�s leadership, some of the Avengers briefly operate under these guidelines, as they seek to halt the dissenting Captain America�s rogue actions, along with the Avengers who fight with him. With Iron Man and Captain America�s conflict escalating and left unresolved, the Avengers effectively break up�though Stark, War Machine (James Rhodes) and Vision still operate out of Avengers headquarters, there is no longer an ongoing team.

The reunion of many Avengers during Thanos� attack on Earth, including Steve Rogers, finds the team operating on their own again and against the wishes of the government, as Rhodes disobeys direct orders from Thaddeus Ross to arrest fugitives Rogers, Wanda Maximoff, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson."
"The Avengers� first-ever adversary is the Asgardian god of mischief, Loki, who attempts to rule the Earth, aided by an invading Chitauri army. Loki was, in fact, working at the behest of the Mad Titan, Thanos, who would formulate new plans in the wake of Loki�s defeat.

"Nick Fury originally brings the Avengers together and the team forms a close relationship with the S.H.I.E.L.D. Director, along with agents Phil Coulson and Maria Hill�with Coulson�s death proving instrumental in uniting the initially squabbling heroes together.Geneticist Dr. Helen Cho provides the Avengers with support, and though it was under the sway of Ultron and Scarlet Witch (before the latter switched sides), Cho was instrumental in helping create the future Avenger known as Vision. Thor�s friend Dr. Erik Selvig was used by Loki to help him, but ultimately assists the Avengers, including helping set up their second headquarters in upstate New York. While never officially joining the Avengers before his untimely death, Quicksilver fights alongside the team against Ultron in Sokovia.

After the destruction of Sokovia and a deadly mishap in Lagos, the Avengers become split over the Sokovia Accords. Though not officially working as an Avenger at this point, Captain America is helped not only by fellow Avengers Hawkeye, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch, but also by Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Bucky Barnes. In the meantime, Iron Man, still officially sanctioned, is assisted by teammates Vision, War Machine, and Black Widow, as well as Wakanda�s Prince T�Challa, the Black Panther, and Spider-Man (Peter Parker). Many former members of the Avengers reunite to battle Thanos� army, and are joined by Barnes, T�Challa, Okoye, M�Baku, Shuri, and the united forces of Wakanda. While ostensibly operating on his own, and not with the Avengers, Tony Stark, while traveling into space to face Thanos, declares the accompanying Spider-Man now an Avenger, while joining forces with Doctor Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy members Star-Lord, Mantis, and Drax. Two other Guardians, Groot and Rocket, also come to the aid of the Avengers members in Wakanda."
"As the Avengers valiantly fought against the Chitauri, Fury assured the World Security Council that the new team could handle the situation in New York, but the Council wanted to nuke New York to prevent the potential spread of an invasion. They launched a missile, which was re-directed by Iron Man into the wormhole opened by Loki. The bomb detonated in outer space, destroying the Chitauri hive mind, while Stark passed out and began to plummet to Earth, only to be saved by the Hulk. After their victory, and with Loki taken into custody, the Avengers enjoyed some shawarma together. Soon after, Loki was taken back to Asgard by Thor to stand trial for his crimes, and the team went their separate ways�though Stark was motivated to begin turning his tower in Manhattan into Avengers Tower, which could function as the team�s headquarters.

Sometime later, Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated from the start, and to its very core, by HYDRA, leading them to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. completely alongside Nick Fury and Maria Hill. In the wake of this, Fury would go into hiding�presumed dead by the world�while Hill would go to work for Stark.

The Avengers, with Avengers Tower as their base of operations, reunited, with the team going on missions to track down and neutralize remaining HYDRA factions. HYDRA leader Wolfgang von Strucker had by this point gained possession of Loki�s scepter and used it to turn siblings Wanda and Pietro Maximoff into super powered operatives known as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. The Avengers raided his facility and took back the scepter, while the Maximoff twins escaped."
"Back at Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner, hoping to create a preemptive defense system that would make the Avengers obsolete, used the scepter�s power and a program they�d been developing - only to inadvertently create a homicidal robot, Ultron, who was hellbent on destroying all life on Earth. Following his emergence from Avengers Tower, Ultron then recruited the Maximoff siblings, who blamed Tony Stark for the death of their parents, after they were killed by a missile Stark created, to sow discord among the Avengers.

Ultron created the perfect body for himself with the Mind Stone�previously hidden inside Loki�s scepter�embedded in his forehead. Ultron was thwarted from uploading his consciousness into the body thanks to Wanda, who realized, just in time, his intention to kill every human being on the planet. Instead, with the Avengers retrieving the body themselves, Thor helped bring it to life inhabited not by Ultron, but by the reconceptualization of Tony�s AI, JARVIS. Thus, Vision was born, proving to the skeptical Avengers that his intentions were pure when he was the first one among them, save Thor himself, who was fully capable of lifting Thor�s hammer."
"Back in Sokovia, Ultron caused the country�s capital city to fly up into the sky, intending to create a global extinction event by sending the city smashing back to the ground. With Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver fighting by their side, the Avengers arrived, taking down hordes of Ultron drones, while attempting to get as many civilians to safety as they could�eventually aided by War Machine and Nick Fury, Maria Hill, and other former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents whose Helicarrier was invaluable in getting Sokovians off the floating city. The majority of Sokovians were rescued, even as the Avengers were forced to blow up the city in order to save the Earth. Ultron, in the meantime, was stopped completely, as all of his sentries were destroyed, with Vision taking out the final robot before it could escape. The aftermath of this battle created a lot of changes to the Avengers roster. Although he might have joined, Pietro was killed in the battle protecting Hawkeye. Hulk decided to fly off in the Avengers� Quinjet after helping in the fight, rather than rejoin the team. Thor returned to the cosmos to investigate the unsettling number of events involving Infinity Stones, while Tony Stark decided to take a step back from the team.

Now working out of a new headquarters owned by Stark in upstate New York, Captain America and Black Widow formed a second incarnation of the Avengers, comprised of the two of them and new recruits Vision, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, and War Machine.

During a mission in Lagos to stop Crossbones (Brock Rumlow), Scarlet Witch, acting to save Captain America when Rumlow set off an explosive device intended to kill both himself and Cap, used her powers to send the explosive hurtling into the air�accidently killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers when the explosion hit the building they were in. Wracked with guilt over this event and others, Tony, working with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, backed the introduction of the Sokovia Accords. Agreed upon by the United Nations, the Accords� purpose was to create oversight when it comes to the actions of the Avengers, meaning a UN panel would be able to control what missions they took and what parts of the world they traveled to.  The Accords caused a major rift between Tony and Steve Rogers, who strongly opposed them. Both recruited heroes to their sides after Rogers old friend, Bucky Barnes, was framed for the bombing of the Accords ratification summit, which resulted in the death of Wakanda�s king, T�Chaka. The situation escalated, as Rogers was actively helping a wanted criminal avoid the authorities, made worse by Barnes� past as the brainwashed HYDRA assassin called the Winter Soldier, whose body count was infamous long before the UN summit was bombed.Standing with Stark to bring in Rogers, Barnes, and their allies were Rhodes, Vision, and Romanoff, while Wakanda�s Prince T�Challa, the Black Panther, and Spider-Man (Peter Parker), were also recruited to help. Rogers and Barnes were joined in their fight by fellow Avengers Falcon, Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, along with Ant-Man. (Scott Lang) The two teams had a ferocious fight at an airport in Berlin, which culminated in Rogers and Barnes� escaping thanks to an assist by Romanoff, who switched sides, while Rhodes was badly injured by a miscalculated shot from his teammate, Vision."
"Rogers and Barnes learned the true culprit behind the bombing was Sokovian intelligence officer Helmut Zemo, tracking him to a HYDRA base in Siberia. Stark also learned Zemo was responsible, and briefly teamed with Rogers and Barnes to bring him in�only for Zemo to reveal to Stark that Bucky, while brainwashed and operating on HYDRA�s orders, had killed Tony�s parents. Having learned both the shocking circumstances of his parents� death, and that Rogers had already known this, but kept the truth from him, Tony was unable to contain his rage. Iron Man engaged in a vicious fight with Captain America and Bucky, ending with Iron Man�s defeat and Captain America and Bucky�s escape, while Black Panther stopped Zemo from killing himself and took him into custody.Shortly after, Rogers would break his friends and allies Maximoff, Barton, Lang, and Wilson out of confinement in the prison called the Raft. While Lang and Barton, not willing to be away from their families, would accept deals and go under house arrest, Rogers, Maximoff, and Wilson would go on the run as fugitives. They were joined by Romanoff, now also wanted for her betrayal of Stark�s team in Berlin.

Stark, Vision, and Rhodes�learning to use a device from Stark in order to walk again following his injury�still occupied Avengers headquarters. Although there was no longer an ongoing Avengers team in operation, Stark offered Parker Avengers membership, which the young man declined. Rogers, in the meantime, sent Stark a note about how sorry he was about what had occurred, along with a phone that could be used to reach him in an emergency.

As time went on, Vision and Scarlet Witch began secretly seeing each other, exploring a potential romance. In New York, Bruce Banner returned to Earth after years off-planet, warning the sorcerers Doctor Strange and Wong about the impending threat of Thanos, after he witnessed the massacre of the Asgardian refugees."
"Tony Stark was brought to Strange�s sanctum, learning more about Thanos� plan to assemble all six Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all life in the universe. When Thanos� agents came for the Time Stone that Strange possessed, Strange was taken onboard their ship, with Iron Man and Spider-Man, who had come to help, both stowing away on the ship. Freeing Strange from captivity, Iron Man declared Spider-Man was now officially an Avenger, as the trio traveled to Thanos� long dead home planet of Titan, where they encountered Guardians of the Galaxy members Star-Lord, Mantis, and Drax.

On Earth, Banner used Stark�s phone, dropped during the confrontation over the Time Stone, to contact Rogers. Thanks to Banner�s warning, Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson arrived to help Maximoff and Vision in Scotland, who were also under attack by two of the Children of Thanos, who sought Vision�s Mind Stone. Fending them off, the former Avengers traveled back to the team�s old headquarters, where they reunited with Rhodes and Banner. Thaddeus Ross ordered Rhodes to arrest the returning. Knowing the Mind Stone needed to be destroyed to keep it from Thanos, a plan was devised to safely remove it from Vision first, which required the technological expertise of Wakanda. With T�Challa agreeing to help, Rogers� expanded group traveled to Wakanda and readied to fight alongside T�Challa himself, Barnes, and the mighty forces of the country, as Thanos sent an army to retrieve the Mind Stone. A massive battle broke out, with the Avengers receiving crucial aid by the timely arrival of Thor, who also finally returned to Earth, having crafted a powerful new weapon, the axe called Stormbreaker, to take down Thanos. Thor and his Guardians of the Galaxy friends Groot and Rocket helped turn the tide, with Thanos� forces beginning to crumble.

On Titan, Iron Man and his allies attempted to not only stop Thanos himself from personally acquiring the Time Stone, but also wrest his Infinity Gauntlet, which he was using to harness all of the stones, from his hand. Unfortunately, even with Thanos� vengeful daughter, Nebula, joining their fight, this plan would fail. When Thanos nearly killed Iron Man, Doctor Strange offered up the Time Stone in exchange for Stark�s life. Thanos accepted, and traveled back to Earth."
"On Earth, none of the heroes could stop Thanos as he made his way towards Vision, who still had the Mind Stone inside his head, with the surgery to remove it having been interrupted by the fighting. Vision, having accepted that his sacrifice was necessary, asked Scarlet Witch to destroy the stone, and him with it, and she tearfully did so� only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to bring Vision back just long enough to tear the stone out of his head, brutally killing Vision, but affording the Titan all six Infinity Stones. Thor managed to throw his axe into Thanos� chest, but it was too late�Thanos told Thor he should have aimed for his head, before snapping his fingers and wiping out half of the life in the universe.Many began to instantly disintegrate on the Wakandan battlefield, including Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, and Groot. On Titan, the same fate befell Mantis, Drax, Star-Lord, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man, leaving Iron Man and Nebula alone on the dead planet. Back on Earth, the horrified and stunned Captain America, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, Thor, and Rocket gathered, trying to comprehend what had just occurred."
"The Guardians of the Galaxy�s origins can be traced to Earth native Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, betraying Yondu Udontu and his Ravagers and pre-emptively stealing a valuable Orb they were after. In retaliation, Yondu put a bounty on Quill�s head, which mercenaries Rocket and Groot were eager to claim.

Also on Quill�s tail was Gamora, a warrior assassin and adoptive daughter to Thanos. She had been loaned out as muscle to the Kree zealot Ronan the Accuser in order to help him track down the Orb. Gamora decided to betray Ronan and Thanos, not wishing the Orb and its potentially lethal power to get in their hands, and made a deal to sell the Orb to a being known as the Collector.

On Xandar, Quill and Gamora battled over the Orb, as Rocket and Groot intervened to detain Quill. During their skirmish, they were all captured by the Nova Corps and arrested. The four were sent to a high security prison, the Kyln, where they were joined by fellow prisoner Drax, whose family had been killed thanks to Thanos and Ronan. While locked up, the wary partners formulated their escape and a plan to sell the Orb and split the profits. In the wake of their breakout, the five outlaws would all come realize the threat Ronan held, and put their own lives on the line to stop him, in the process becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy."
"All members of the Guardians of the Galaxy have been involved in some sort of mercenary activity and are exceptional hand-to-hand combatants with notable tactical skills.While the team has, in theory, redeemed themselves for earlier crimes, and were pardoned by the Nova Corps, they frequently continue to operate outside the law. The group often work for money, taking jobs from wealthy clients like the Sovereign high priestess, Ayesha. They will also do good deeds without the promise of payment, though often with the hope that a reward will be included in the long run.        "
"The Guardians have amassed a number of foes in their quest to protect the universe, and make a little dough on the side. The Mad Titan Thanos is Gamora�s adoptive father and a being of immense strength and cruelty. He will stop at nothing to get ahold of all six Infinity Stones, which puts him in conflict with the Guardians, and inadvertently sets into motion the events that bring them together.

Ronan the Accuser of the Kree Empire is a radical zealot who first works for Thanos to gain possession of the Power Stone, before deciding he wants it for himself. After Gamora betrays him, the Guardians battle Ronan for control of the Power Stone.The Sovereign and their High Priestess originally give the Guardians a job to defeat an Abilisk, a creature feeding off their home planet�s power source, Anulax Batteries. After they defeat the Abilisk, Rocket steals some of those same batteries, leading the Sovereign to hunt the team.

Ego is a Celestial being, and biological father of Peter Quill. He attempts to conquer the universe with Quill�s help, but the Guardians stand against him when the truth of his intentions is revealed."
"The Guardians have also gathered a number of friends and allies, despite their outlaw status.

Yondu Udontu straddles the ally and enemy roles depending on his mood and the payoff, but he ultimately ends up an ally of the Guardians�first helping them against Ronan in order to profit from the Orb, and then making a stand for good against Ego.The Nova Corps are an intergalactic armed force led by Nova Prime. Initially pitted against each other, they become allies with the Guardians when the latter work with them to protect Xandar from Ronan�s plan to annihilate the planet. Corpsmen Dey and Denarian Saal specifically are among the Nova Corps officers that detain the outlaws, but later team up with them against Ronan.

Nebula, like Gamora, is Thanos� adoptive daughter, and is similarly cybernetically enhanced and trained as an assassin. While she is first an enemy of the Guardians, assisting Ronan, she and Gamora mend fences, and she eventually becomes an ally against both Ego and Thanos."
"During their detainment in the Kyln, Gamora, Quill, and the duo of Rocket and Groot agreed to work together to escape and then sell the Orb Quill had stolen. They were joined by fellow prisoner Drax, whose own family had been killed by Thanos and Ronan. After Drax was convinced that Gamora too, despite her previous affiliation, was an enemy of Thanos and Ronan, the five outlaws broke out together. On Knowhere, the group met with their buyer, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector. He revealed to them that the Orb held the Power Stone, an Infinity Stone capable of mowing down entire civilizations. Before their deal was completed, Tivan�s slave, Carina, attempting to strike back at Tivan, grabbed for the stone, only for it kill her and destroy Tivan�s museum. The sale to Tivan disrupted, the group debated what to do with the Orb, with Gamora insisting that it go to the Nova Corp and stay out of Ronan�s hands.

When both Ronan and Yondu separately arrived seeking the outlaws and the Orb, a space battle ensued. Gamora implored with Nebula to prevent Ronan from obtaining the stone, but Nebula instead shot her sister�s craft, sending Gamora into space while Nebula retrieved the Orb. Quill exited his pod to save Gamora, nearly sacrificing himself in the process. After Yondu took Quill and Gamora onboard his ship, Quill convinced Yondu to partner with them against Ronan, promising him the Orb when Ronan was defeated. When Rocket, Groot, and Drax arrived to save their new teammates, they learned of this new plan, as Quill begged the group to help him save the galaxy. Realizing the odds against them, Rocket noted Quill was essentially asking them to die, but even he relented and joined the others in their pledge to help.

In the battle that followed on and above Xandar, Groot showed his true prowess as a fighter, slaying a large group of Ronan�s men, while Nebula fled after a fight with Gamora. When Ronan grabbed Drax by the throat, Rocket flew his ship into Ronan�s craft, the Dark Aster, sending the Aster careening towards the ground. Despite Rocket�s protests, Groot enveloped his friends in his protective branches, absorbing the impact, but causing his own death."
"When Quill needed help harnessing the Power Stone, Rocket, Quill, Gamora, and Drax all joined hands with him, and the teammates were able to defeat Ronan. Now dubbed the Guardians of the Galaxy�a name Ronan had called them in jest�the group were pardoned for their previous crimes by the Nova Corp. As promised, Quill gave Yondu the Orb, but revealed to Gamora that he switched out the Orbs and retained the stone, which was given to Nova Prime for safekeeping.

In the aftermath, Rocket, mourning his friend, planted one of the twigs remaining from Groot�s sacrifice, only for that planting to sprout into a new spawn of Groot. A short time later, the Guardians were hired by the Sovereign and their High Priestess Ayesha to defeat an Abilisk, a creature feeding off their home planet�s power source, the Anulax Batteries, which were worth thousands of units a piece. Successful in their battle, the Guardians were granted custody of Nebula, who the Sovereign had previously captured. However, Rocket stole some of the prized batteries for himself and the Sovereign, discovering the betrayal, chased after them.

The Guardians were saved from the Sovereign attack by the Celestial Ego, accompanied by his assistant, Mantis. Ego revealed himself to be Peter Quill�s father, and Quill, Gamora, and Drax decided to travel to Ego�s planet and learn more about him, while Rocket and Groot stayed behind to repair their ship, keeping an eye on Nebula. Yondu and his Ravagers arrived to secure the batteries and ended up battling Rocket, with a Ravager mutiny leading Yondu and Rocket to be locked up together, while Nebula was set free and went looking for Gamora."
"Upon arriving at Ego�s planet, Quill, Gamora, and Drax learned that he was effectively the planet itself, able to manipulate matter and energy on a massive scale, while Quill bonded with his father.

Nebula�s attack on Gamora led to the two sisters finally beginning to repair their relationship, only to discover the grisly truth about Ego�that he�d killed scores of his own children, after finding them to not have the Celestial gene he required. Ego, in the meantime, informed Quill of his �expansion� plan, where he and Peter would use their combined power to unlock seeds Ego had left on planets throughout the galaxy, allowing him to turn them all into aspects of himself. An entranced Peter was, at first, seemingly going to comply, until Ego revealed he had caused the fatal tumor that killed Peter�s mother, undoing any attempt to sway Peter to his side.

Meanwhile, with the help of Groot�who was not locked up, but turned into an abused Ravager �mascot��and a regretful Kraglin Obfonteri, Rocket and Yondu broke free and laid waste to those who�d turned on Yondu. Bonding over their similarities, Yondu agreed to help Rocket save the rest of the Guardians."
"The reunited Guardians, joined by Nebula, Yondu, Kraglin, and Mantis�turning against her master�fought against Ego, even as they had to also battle against the Sovereign, who had tracked them down once more. The Guardians were ultimately victorious, setting off a bomb at Ego�s core that destroyed him, with Quill accepting that Ego�s death would also rob him of any Celestial abilities. Yondu sacrificed himself in order to rescue Quill from the exploding planet, with Quill realizing in Yondu�s final moments that he was the father figure he�d always been looking for. Nebula left to search for Thanos, intending to kill him, while the Guardians of the Galaxy, now joined by Mantis, returned to their adventures�even as Groot grew into adolescence, and an accompanying belligerent nature."
"Sometime later, the group received a distress call from a ship of refugee Asgardians who had come under attack. They arrived to find the ship destroyed, but discovered only one survivor, Thor. Thor informed the Guardians that Thanos was behind the attack, having accelerated his hunt for all six Infinity Stones, retrieving the Power Stone from Xandar and now the Space Stone from the Asgardians. Gamora warned that should Thanos succeed in bringing all the stones together, he could succeed in his goal of exterminating half the universe with a simple snap of his fingers.

 

Thor, Rocket, and Groot left together on a mission to forge a weapon Thor could use against Thanos, while Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis traveled to Knowhere, hoping to protect the Reality Stone, which was in the Collector�s possession. On the way, Gamora made Quill promise to kill her should Thanos get hold of her, explaining she knew sensitive information which he could use to destroy the entire universe."
"Unfortunately, the group arrived on Knowhere too late. Though Thanos first fooled them with an illusion that made it seem like he didn�t have the Reality Stone yet, and that Gamora was able to fatally stab him, in truth he had already gotten the stone and laid waste to Knowhere. When Gamora was grabbed by Thanos, Quill reluctantly tried to shoot her, as promised, only for Thanos to turn his blast into harmless bubbles and teleport himself and Gamora away.

 

On Nidavellir, Rocket used his ship to assist Thor and the dwarf Eitri to create a new axe for Thor, Stormbreaker. Thor nearly died making the weapon, and Groot�until this point acting uninterested in the events around him�used his own arm to make the axe�s handle.

 

As Thanos� prisoner, Gamora learned he also had captured Nebula, and seeing her sister tortured caused Gamora to give Thanos the location of the Soul Stone. On the planet Vormir, Thanos learned he must sacrifice something he loved to gain possession of the Soul Stone, and threw Gamora from a cliff, proving he truly loved her in the same moment he ended her life."
"On Thanos� home planet, Titan, Quill, Mantis, and Drax encountered Earth heroes Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man and initially battled them, before they realized they were are all enemies of Thanos. Quill came up with a plan to wrest the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos when he arrived to take possession of the Time Stone from Doctor Strange. Joined by Nebula, the group nearly succeeded in stopping Thanos. When Quill learned Thanos had killed Gamora, his rage caused him to strike out, breaking the hold Mantis had on Thanos, who fought back at full strength. With Strange trading the Time Stone for Iron Man�s life, Thanos departed for Earth, with an incredulous Star-Lord asking if they just lost.

 

On Earth, Thor, Rocket, and Groot fought Thanos� forces alongside several Avengers and their allies in Wakanda, with their arrival turning the tide of the battle. However, when Thanos arrived, he was able to get the Mind Stone, the last of the Infinity Stones he desired. With a snap of his fingers, he ended half the life in the universe, including Groot, who disintegrated into nothingness, along with many others on the battlefield. On Titan, the same tragic fate befell Star-Lord, Mantis, and Drax, leaving Rocket as the last surviving member of the Guardians of the Galaxy."
"In a world without S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers need support! Coming together to tackle threats across realities, the Agents of Wakanda are that support team made up of superhuman agents, intelligence gatherers, and stealth operatives�people with a wide variety of skills who can operate in any situation imaginable.
 When global tensions skyrocket after Dark Celestials invade Earth, the Avengers are re-formed as the Mighty Avengers. King T�Challa of Wakanda, AKA Black Panther, becomes the new Chairman of the Avengers team. In need of support staff, he handpicks a new squad to help him out: the Agents of Wakanda. T�Challa kicks off his recruiting process with General Okoye by reaching out to former environmental S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Rosalind �Roz� Solomon who could use a new outlet for her background in spy work.

Okoye gives Roz a tour of Agents of Wakanda�s headquarters in Wakanda, introducing her to other new recruits and shows her the weapons room, replete with advanced weaponry, guns containing Vibranium bullets, and a vehicle that can teleport. Since the agents are support staff for the Avengers, Wakandan HQ is connected to theirs at Avengers Mountain, which is run out of a Dark Celestial�s corpse. Therefore, they can use the Celestial energy to teleport between the two locations and various spots around the globe. Okoye offers Roz to reside in either location, but with Roz� past intimate relationship with Avenger Thor Odinson, AKA Thor, and her leftover trauma from her past in Broxton, Oklahoma when she killed countless Trolls, she opts for alternate lodgings.

Roz then goes on a covert mission to unearth intel about King Malekith�s War of the Realms. She travels across the globe, tracking down extradimensional energy matching any of the ten realms. She then comes upon strange methane readings emitting from an apartment in Queens and finds that it contains a magical interior, home to a terrorist cell of Malekith�s Dark Elves and Trolls along with their secret Black Bifrost�similar to the Asgardian Rainbow Bridge�which allows them to pass from here to their home world of Svartalfheim. She decides to handle it herself after a Frost Giant passes through the Bifrost, but ends up in trouble and calling another Thor ex-girlfriend and friend, Jane Foster, for some advice on how to defeat the behemoth. She suggests that Roz call Thor for an assist, Roz refuses, and uses her teleporting car to transport the remaining Troll, whom she shoots in the stomach, and impossible-to-kill giant to the hottest place on Earth. Thor arrives to help, but Roz� plan worked, the Frost Giant melted and the Troll dead. She passes along her intel about the Bifrost and warns him that Malekith will bring his War of the Realms and armies to Earth. She then met up with Dario Agger, AKA Minotaur, in his human form. As C.E.O. of the Roxxon Energy Corporation, he sold out the Earth to Malekith, though he plays dumb about it with Roz nearly shooting him, but she decides not to waste a bullet."
"The Agents of Wakanda�s next recruit is former S.H.E.I.L.D. agent and Agent of Atlas, the cursed man who is forever a gorilla until someone kills him, Kenneth Hale, AKA Gorilla-Man. Panther then asks Janet Van Dyne, AKA the Wasp, to join, relying on her experience as a capable leader and founding Avenger. She then recruits Eric Brooks, AKA Blade, for T�Challa, from Dracula�s forces who imprisoned him.

Meanwhile, while Okoye is leery about T�Challa�s choices for this new team, he appoints her as their Director. She picks up another recruit, the Lord of the Savage Land, Kevin Plunder, AKA Ka-Zar, who does not make her feel more confident in her king. T�Challa then offers an I.T. job to one of the smartest beings on Earth, the mutant alien Broo, formerly an X-student.

When Wasp picks up another recruit in Earth�s orbit, Dr. Michael Morbius, AKA Morbius, the Living Vampire�a vampire created through science to be precise�a brood of vampires attack their ship. This attack signals a potential civil war in Transylvania between the vampires as some want to dethrone Dracula. As Wasp departs the space ship to get rid of their attackers, astronaut and fellow Agent of Wakanda recruit John Jameson, AKA Man-Wolf, joins the fray and helps defeat them.The next recruits that arrive to Avengers Mountain are the Navajo super-cop, Jason Strongbow, AKA American Eagle, whose priorities are to his reservation but he commits to being an agent a couple days a week. Then there�s mutant genius with x-ray eyes an hypodermic pistols, James Bradley, AKA Dr. Nemesis, who is up for it as long as he gets paid and can kill some Nazis, and last but not least, the master of Kung Fu and hedonism, Fat Cobra. Welcomed by Gorilla-Man, the team gets ready to embark on their first adventure together.

"
"Asgard�s All-Father Odin Borson, AKA Odin, acts as the unofficial adviser to the Avengers Chairman, Black Panther. His insight into the history of Earth proves useful and while T�Challa reports to him, he isn�t necessarily patient with his tall tales. T�Challa then handpicks the Agents of Wakanda himself and also reports to the Avengers, considering his Chairman status. He makes recommendations to them for active roster additions to the team, such as Blade, human-vampire hybrid and hunter.

He appoints the leader of the Dora Milaje, General Okoye, as director of the agents, leaning on her skills as a tactician and Wakandan warrior. She also has final say on who makes the team�s roster. The team acts as a superhuman support crew to the Avengers and the agents must be capable of working alone, undetected in inhospitable locations across existence. Based out of Wakanda, the Avengers Mountain on the North Pole�out of a Dark Celestial�s frozen corpse�and the Agents of Wakanda Helicarrier, the agents make up an intelligence-gathering outfit of stealth operatives.

The Wasp secures assets in hostile territories, like Blade and Morbius the Living Vampire. Gorilla-Man brings his strength and dexterity to the fold as the new Chief of Security, while the highly intelligent mutant Broo is the head of I.T. at Avengers Mountain. The Lord of the Savage Land, Ka-Zar, acts as a super spy, typically without specialized equipment. Man-Wolf brings his background as a former Avengers support staffer and personal Quinjet pilot to Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, on top of his ability to survive in space. American Eagle uses his superhuman strength and speed to split his time between protecting the Navajo Nation and helping out the agents. The brilliant Dr. Nemesis brings his experience with the X-Men along with two demands, getting paid and the opportunity to kill Nazis. Fat Cobra is an Immortal Weapon, like Danny Rand, AKA Iron Fist, and one the world�s deadliest Kung Fu champions. He comes from defending the mystical city of Peng Lai, so he knows all about magical threats. Roz Solomon brings her many years at S.H.I.E.L.D. as a covert operative that gathers intelligence to the Agents of Wakanda."

"With the Avengers struggling to keep the peace between aggressive factions�Russia�s Winter Guard, Namor�s Defenders of the Deep, Dracula�s vampiric hordes, and the U.S. government-sanctioned Squadron Supreme�the Agents of Wakanda use their connections and skills to gather intelligence as support staff. Gorilla-Man met with Ursa Major, in an inconspicuous location, the Wundagore Zoo in Transia, despite Ursa�s displeasure with such a stupid meeting locale. Gorilla-Man confirmed that Ursa sent Dracula to Chernobyl upon  Panther�s request and told him to continue playing his part as a big, surly drunk, though they were interrupted by Ka-Zar in a flying car conspicuously yelling that they needed to get back to base since their advanced cell service was down.

By the time they got back to Avengers Mountain, the populace of New York City had been evacuated there by Dr. Steven Strange, AKA Doctor Strange, as the War of the Realms spilled onto Earth. As the Wasp led the evacuees to the bunkers, Panther asked Gorilla-Man if he could keep everyone secure. He responded with a resounding answer, that they�d be ready for anything. Though, he was acting a double agent himself, in league with the Legion of the Unliving, a servant of the Damned to undo the curse upon him. When the final battle for Midgard began, the Agents of Wakanda are dispatched to Antarctica to assist Blade against Roxxon Super-Soldiers. Broo joined as well but when Roxxon deployed their B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R. Squad, hulked-out super-soldiers, Gorilla-Man scooped Broo up and made haste away from them as Ka-Zar and Blade fought them off alongside the Vanir, the immortal Lords and Ladies of Vanaheim. Meanwhile, Roz teamed up with Jane Foster, AKA All-Mother of Asgard, and together they fought back Minotaur who tried to lay claim to Antarctica based on his deal with Malekith to own it."
"After the end of the War of the Realms, with Earth victorious, the agents are called to a small town in Oklahoma that was under attack by a dark energy source. What they found was the Sentry merged with the Void. They stop him from destroying the town, but receive a startling report from Broo and Gorilla-Man who discovered strange anomalies around Earth�s Lunar orbit. Then they dropped off the grid, and when T�Challa and the agents arrived to the Moon, a strange vine-like creature attacked them. The team found Broo and Gorilla-Man underground, trapped in pods filled with hallucinogens. In an effort to free them, Agents Jameson and Okoye became trapped as well and T�Challa was expelled to the surface. Enter Barbara �Bobbi� Morse, AKA Mockingbird, the latest recruit to the Agents of Wakanda, who helped them out of their strange situation. Eventually they figured out the vine creature�s name was Entea and she fed off the energy of the moon. Since the moon has nothing to survive on, she starved, until Man-Wolf shared some of his star gem�s energy with her. But it wasn�t enough, so he decided to open a portal to Other Realm, the universe at his command as Stargod, a role he gained previously.

When they arrived, it�s desolate and destroyed. While Man-Wolf felt regret, like he failed the people of Other Realm, T�Challa reminded him of the complexities of the situation, and that being all things to all people is a responsibility to shoulder and he must decide if he�s willing to do it. Entea then decided to move to Other Realm, to feed and germinate at the same time, as Man-Wolf chose to stay as well and look for other signs of life. The agents left him with the Spearpoint-O which would transport him back to Earth when he felt ready to come back to the Agents of Wakanda."
"A cosmic Celestial known as Ego visited an untold number of planets to seed them as preparation for his Expansion, during which he would assimilate all life in the cosmos. As part of this process, he needed a second Celestial, which led him to woo and impregnate females on the planets he visited. He unexpectedly fell in love with one such woman, the Earthling Meredith Quill. Fearing she would distract him from his true mission, Ego caused her to develop a fatal brain tumor and then left her to raise the product of their relationship, their son Peter, by herself.

Peter lived with Meredith in Missouri until the night she passed away from the tumor. The eight-year-old boy was subsequently abducted from Earth by aliens. Yondu Udonta, the leader of the Ravagers mercenary band that kidnapped the boy, had been paid by Ego to deliver Peter to him. Yondu reneged on the deal when he discovered the other children he�d retrieved for Ego had been killed (after Ego discovered they were not in fact Celestials and could not help him) and raised Quill as a Ravager instead."
"During his youth as a member of the Ravagers, Quill attempted to introduce them to some of his favorite Earth traditions. He told Kraglin all about Christmas, got gifts for everyone and the pair even worked on decorating a tree. However, Yondu saw all this and was not pleased. He smashed the tree and told him to trash the gifts.

Later, Yondu secretly opened the gift from Peter. It was a small figurine he placed on the dashboard of the ship, starting his tchotchke collection. Without letting the others know, Yondu then gifted the boy his quad blasters. The pair did not speak about the exchange, but did share a nice moment afterwards.After reaching adulthood, Quill struck out on his own with all the experience he�d gained with the Ravagers, a spaceship of his own, and his mother�s mixtape of Earth pop tunes to restyle himself as Star-Lord, the galaxy�s most notorious thief� a status completely in his own mind."
"As Star-Lord, Quill utilizes several pieces of equipment, most likely gained during his time with the Ravagers, such as a mask-helmet that allows him to breathe in space. He also uses a unique double-barrel blaster pistol, boot thrusters for limited flight, and a starship he dubs the Milano. In addition, Quill sports multiple devices and tools that aid in his thievery.

Star-Lord himself is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, though he seems to prefer shooting to punching. He keeps himself in shape, though, and has been able to withstand certain degrees of physical abuse from his opponents. Though not of low intelligence, Quill possesses a clever mind that while useful in some situations, tends to get him into trouble more often than not."
"In his travels around the galaxy, Star-Lord has picked up more than a few enemies. In fact, given his ego and bluster, more people probably hate him than love him.Quill earns the enmity of the Kree warrior called Ronan the Accuser and his troops when the thief purloins the object known as the Orb from a dead world. This leads to a massive effort from Ronan to acquire it for himself and a world of hurt for Quill. Still, in the end, Star-Lord offers to settle the entire matter �interstellar war�with a so-called �dance-off,� but the Accuser doesn�t accept the offer in the spirit it was given.

Sadly, one of Peter Quill�s greatest foes turns out to be his own father, the Celestial known as Ego. It began well, with father reaching out to son to gift him with his legacy. But when Star-Lord discovers Ego�s part in the death of Meredith Quill, and his dark intentions for the universe at large, blood becomes thinner than water and open war is declared.Quill gains the wrath of Ayesha, the leader of the Sovereign race. Star-Lord also forms a burning enmity against Thanos the space tyrant, who brings about a very personal loss to Quill."
"Quill operates almost entirely on his own after leaving the Ravagers, beyond brief relationships with women across the galaxy. This solo act continues until he meets the group of individuals who join with him in becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy and builds unique rapports with each of them.The assassin Gamora becomes perhaps the most complex of Star-Lord�s relationships amongst the Guardians. Quill holds her in high esteem and the frustrations between the two eventually relent as they began a romantic relationship. Drax�s childlike nature can be trying for Quill, as can Rocket�s competitive nature and the alien raccoon�s tendency toward theft, which at times exceeds Quill�s own thieving urges. As for Groot, Quill acts as something of a parental figure to the walking, talking tree-alien, a status that Groot himself doesn�t seem to care for. Quill welcomes Mantis to the Guardians, while also learning to work alongside former enemy Nebula.

The strange bond between Quill and the man who raised him, Yondu Udonta of the Ravagers, defies description for many year, until the blue-skinned mercenary opens Star-Lord�s eyes to the truth about his father and supplants Ego in the young thief�s eyes. The man who was once seen as an adversary and someone to beat, becomes a father-figure himself."
"Star-Lord acquired knowledge of a valuable item called the Orb and one-upped his old mentor Yondu by stealing it before the Ravagers could get their hands on it. In doing so, Quill also acquired the interest of the Kree warrior Ronan, who wanted the Orb for his lord, the dreaded Thanos. But, when the thief tried to sell the object on the Xandarian homeworld, he was arrested by the Nova Corps and unceremoniously thrown into prison. There he gained the partnership of Gamora, Rocket, Groot, and Drax, and together the little band escaped from incarceration and made their way to the far-off place called Knowhere to attempt to sell the Orb to the Collector, an eccentric antiquities acquirer.

After the Collector revealed the Orb contained one of the powerful artifacts known as Infinity Stones, Quill and his team were attacked by Ronan�s forces and then rescued by Yondu and the Ravagers. Finally in possession of the Infinity Stone, Ronan turned to attack the Nova Corps on Xandar, prompting Star-Lord to convince his new friends to join in defending the planet. Their infiltration of Ronan�s baseship brought it crashing down to Xandar, where Quill challenged the Accuser directly in a bid to wrest the Stone from him."
"In accessing the object�s power for himself, Peter Quill drew strength from a vision of his late mother and also from his team and together they defeated Ronan and saved everyone. In a gesture of thanks, the Nova Corps expunged Star-Lord�s criminal records from galactic databases and gifted him with a rebuilt starship exactly like the one he lost during the struggle.

Calling themselves by the lofty name of the �Guardians of the Galaxy,� Quill and the others began to take on missions from different parties seeking help on various matters. When the Sovereign race asked the team to win their precious power batteries back from an alien who�d stolen them, which Rocket later stole for himself, it set off another wild adventure for the Guardians."
"Star-Lord�s long-lost father Ego contacted him while the team was fleeing from the angry Sovereigns and directed him to a planet where he would be waiting to receive him. After their reunion, Ego explained why he left Quill�s mother and also how he�d seeded multiple worlds with parts of himself, and then helped his son embrace the incredible power already within him from birth.

At first, Star-Lord reveled in his new abilities, but he subsequently discovered the dark truth behind his father�s explanations: Ego had caused Meredith Quill�s fatal tumor and was planning on terraforming countless worlds in his own image with his son�s added power. Together with a newly arrived Yondu and his fellow Guardians, Quill devised a plan to distract his father while the team planted a bomb on Ego�s brain, deep within the planet they stood upon.

The plan worked and Ego was defeated, but in the process Yondu sacrificed his life to save Peter Quill and his friends, awakening Star-Lord to the realization that the Ravager leader acted as a real father to him, not the cosmic being that had tried to manipulate and use him. Star-Lord arranged for a proper funeral for Yondu, with full honors. In the time that followed, the baby incarnation of Groot began to age and grow. Having taken on a fatherly role with Groot, Quill was exasperated to learn that his charge was now at the temperament one might expect to find in a typical adolescent, complete with a healthy disrespect for Quill�s authority.

"
"When the Guardians later answered a distress call, they discovered the wreckage of a ship that was destroyed by Thanos. Bringing a survivor, the Asgardian god of thunder, Thor, aboard his ship, Quill learned more about Thanos� drive to acquire all six Infinity Stones and destroy half of all life in the universe. Thor took Rocket and Groot with him to forge a weapon to kill Thanos, leaving Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis to head to Knowhere to intercept Gamora�s adoptive father. During the voyage, Gamora made Quill promise he�d kill her if and when she asked, in order to stop Thanos from gaining knowledge only she possessed.

On Knowhere, Quill and the others realized they were too late to stop Thanos from snatching up another Infinity Stone. When Thanos grabbed Gamora, she implored Peter to do as he promised and kill her. Despite the pain it brought him, he finally pulled the trigger on his gun�only for Thanos to use the power of the Infinity Stones so that harmless bubbles were all that were emitted. Thanos escaped with Gamora as his prisoner. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis traveled to Thanos� home planet, Titan, hoping to rescue their teammate. There they met Earth heroes Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man, who were also pursuing Thanos. Quill was key in devising a plan to stop Thanos from gaining Strange�s Infinity Stone."
"When Thanos arrived on Titan, the heroes nearly succeeded in wresting away his Infinity Gauntlet, and all the Infinity Stones it contained, until Quill learned that Thanos had killed Gamora. Unable to control his anger, Quill�s reckless fury inadvertently destroyed the heroes� chance of incapacitating the tyrant, who was able to gain control of Strange�s stone, and departed for Earth.

Soon after, Thanos gained the sixth and final Infinity Stone and carried out his grand design, eliminating half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. On Titan, Peter Quill was one of the unlucky fifty percent who disintegrated into nothingness."
"Later, the surviving Avengers and Guardians worked together to snatch the Infinity Stones from throughout time and used them to bring everyone who had been erased back to life. Quill and the others found themselves still on Titan, but began making their way to Earth thanks to Doctor Strange's magic.

Star-Lord flew into battle against Thanos' forces, blasting away at the enemies. During the fight he was saved by an unexpected encounter with Gamora from the past. When he tried caressing her, she kneed him in the crotch twice and went off to continue fighting alongside the modern-day Nebula. The battle ended when Iron Man gained control of the Infinity Stones and used them to snap past Thanos' forces away, leaving the status of Gamora from that time a mystery. "
"After attending Tony Stark's memorial service, Quill and the Guardians agreed to let Thor travel with them, answering distress calls and helping those in need. He also kept an eye out for any more information about Gamora from the past. The Asgardian's tenure with the team ended when Gorr, the God-Butcher began to truly make his presence felt. Star-Lord and the Guardians dedicated themselves to responding to as many pleas for help as possible while Thor and Korg went to assist Sif. Before parting ways, Peter told the Odinson to get out there and find something or someone to love and fight for.

At some point down the line, Peter and the Guardians purchased Knowhere from the Collector, who left the floating Celestial head after his encounter with Thanos during the Infinity War. Quill dedicated his efforts to repairing the damage done to the place so the citizens could carry on living there, an effort aided by the locals as well as the Guardians."
"Having heard Kraglin recount a story of Peter's childhood and his love of Christmas, Drax and Mantis decided to travel to Earth and bring back his hero, actor Kevin Bacon. They also picked up a lot of decorations, which everyone used to bring some holiday cheer to Knowhere. Quill loved the initial sentiment, but was not pleased when he realized they had kidnapped Bacon and altered his mind with Mantis' powers. Though he asked Kraglin to return the actor to Earth, Bacon stuck around after hearing how important his movies had been to Quill.

Bacon did go back home, but after sharing a special Christmas song. During the gift exchanging portion of the festivities, Quill gave Groot a Gameboy and received a piece of art from the walking tree in return. Peter received an even better gift shortly after when Mantis revealed that she was his half-sister. Quill was delighted to find out he was actually related to someone in the family of misfits he had built for himself. "
"Gamora was a little girl when Thanos and his army invaded her home world, wiping out half the population. Gamora was separated from her mother in the attack, but Thanos himself took a liking to the young girl, giving her a blade as a present and shielding her from seeing the massacre of her people. Taking her in as his adoptive daughter, Thanos would go on to turn her into a living weapon with cybernetic enhancements. As she grew up, Thanos would force Gamora and her adoptive sister Nebula to fight one another, but referred to Gamora�who won every fight�as his favorite daughter."
"Gamora served under Thanos for 20 years, until he agreed to destroy home-world planet of the Xandarians for Ronan the Accuser of the Kree Empire, in exchange for a valuable Orb that contained an Infinity Stone. Thanos loaned the services of Gamora and Nebula to Ronan to aid him in the task. Realizing the mass casualties that would result should Ronan or Thanos gain control of the Orb, Gamora decided to betray them, accepting a high-priced offer from the Collector to retrieve the Orb for him.She discovered that Peter Quill, a Ravager calling himself Star-Lord, had stolen the Orb and intended to sell it on Xandar. Gamora intervened, only to be captured by Xandar's armed forces, the Nova Corps, and sent to prison alongside Quill and the duo Rocket and Groot, who had been seeking a bounty on Quill's head. In prison, they met Drax, with all five outlaws forming an unlikely bond after they escaped together, and Gamora forging a new path as a hero."
"Gamora is a master assassin, combatant, and swordswoman trained as a living weapon under Thanos which gives her the reputation as the �Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy.�

Her alien physiology and surgical modifications give her superhuman strength and agility and she is able to lift others with ease and leap at incredible heights. Her enhancements include a cybernetic skeleton, ocular and respiratory implants, an improved neurological system and regeneration implant. These augmentations give her augmented durability, vision, and stamina.Her favored weapon is a retractable sword, but she is also known to use a retractable bejeweled knife that she was gifted by Thanos as a child. When she is without her typical weaponry, she uses whatever is around her, from turning a ship�s gun turret into a handheld weapon, to seizing knives that are trained against her."
"As an instrument of Thanos for many years, his enemies were once hers as well. But, as she works to redeem her life under the Mad Titan, her foes align with those of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the galaxy itself.

When the Kree zealot, Ronan the Accuser, breaks a peace treaty with the Kree and Xandarians and intends to commit genocide on Xandar, Gamora is moved into taking action against both him and Thanos. She works with the Guardians to put a stop to his plans for massacre.Gamora faces off against The Sovereign and their High Priestess, after they target all the Guardians of the Galaxy because Rocket steals from them. She is also one of the first to learn the true nature and dark intentions of Peter Quill�s father, the Celestial named Ego, and opposes him with the rest of her teammates to save Quill and the universe.

Perhaps Gamora�s most notable enemy is Thanos. Although he is Gamora's adoptive father, his cold and cruel nature�and memories of what he did to her people�ensures Gamora grew up hating him. She also deeply resents what he put her through and forced her to do over the years. A final confrontation with him costs her everything."
"Gamora fights alongside her fellow outlaws turned Guardians of the Galaxy, Peter Quill AKA Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket, Groot, and later, Mantis, developing true friendships with her teammates over time. One of her most important relationships is her bond with Peter Quill, who is romantically interested in her. Initially resistant to Quill�s flirtations, Gamora begins to return his feelings over time, eventually telling Quill that she loves him more than anything. They also tend to act as surrogate parents to the young Groot.

Yondu Udontu straddles the ally and enemy roles depending on his mood, but ultimately sides with the Guardians to stop Ego, as does another Ravager, Kraglin Obfonteri. Gamora has a complicated relationship with her adoptive sister, Nebula, as the duo were pushed to the limits of competitiveness by Thanos� cruelty and manipulation, although Nebula receives much more harsh treatment. While both break free of Thanos, they consider each other enemies for a time, until realizing the bond they truly share. Gamora genuinely cares for her, as it is Nebula�s torment that breaks Gamora�s resolve when Thanos questions her about the Soul Stone."
"After being locked up in the Kyln, Gamora overcame the murderous intentions of the guards and prisoners alike, convincing vengeful fellow prisoner Drax that she was working against Ronan and Thanos, who were responsible for his family�s death. Agreeing to Quill and Rocket�s offer to split the profits from selling the Orb, they managed to escape�retrieving the Orb in the process �along with Groot and Drax."
"Gamora set up a meeting with her buyer on Knowhere, resisting Quill�s attempt to kiss her along the way, while admitting she enjoyed the Earth music he played her. During their meeting with the buyer, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector, they learned the Orb held the Power Stone, one of the fabled Infinity Stones. The intervention of the Collector�s slave, Carina, stopped the sale when she grasped the Power Stone, setting off a large explosion.

When the Ravager Yondu and Ronan simultaneously arrived, both separately seeking the Orb, Nebula�still working with Ronan�shot down Gamora�s craft, sending her into space. Gamora�s body modifications kept her alive long enough for Quill to save her, with Quill risking his own life in the process. Taken onboard Yondu�s ship, a deal was made for them to work together to stop Ronan from gaining the Orb, as long as Yondu was given the Orb when it was done."
"Having infiltrated Ronan�s ship with her allies, Gamora tried to convince Nebula to help them against Ronan, but her sister refused, escaping on her own. On Xandar, Ronan was going to annihilate the populace, but Quill managed to get ahold of the Power Stone. Its power was such that he was unable to wield it himself, but at Gamora�s suggestion, the newly formed Guardians of the Galaxy held hands, allowing them to harness the stone�s power together and defeat Ronan. While Gamora was upset when Quill gave the Orb back to Yondu, it turned out to be a ruse, with the stone itself given to the Nova Corps for protection.

Not long after, the Guardians took a job for the Sovereign. In return for their services, they received Nebula, who the Sovereign had detained, as payment. Pursued shortly after by the Sovereign themselves, due to Rocket stealing priceless batteries from them, the team were saved by Ego, Quill�s biological father.

"
"Gamora initially encouraged a skeptical Quill to give his father a chance, while Thanos� empathetic servant, Mantis, embarrassingly publicly revealed that Quill felt love for Gamora. Attacked on Ego�s planet by Nebula, who had escaped the Guardians, Gamora ended up saving her sister�s life when her ship crashed. Beginning to work through their differences, the sisters were interrupted by their discovery of a massive pile of skeletons left by Ego�learning from Mantis that he had killed his many other children when he discovered they did not possesses the Celestial power he desired in order to complete his expansion plan to take over the universe.

The Guardians, aided by Mantis, Nebula, Yondu, and the Ravager Kraglin, fought against Ego, ultimately defeating him, though at the loss of Yondu�s life. Nebula declined Gamora�s offer to stay with the Guardians, instead leaving to find and kill Thanos, although she accepted and returned Gamora�s farewell embrace."
"Years later, the Guardians received a distress call, discovering the Asgardian Thor amongst the wreckage of a ship. Thor informed the Guardians that Thanos now had acquired two of the six Infinity Stones. Afraid, Gamora warned them that if Thanos got ahold of all six stones, he would be able to destroy the universe with a snap of his fingers. Gamora, Quill, Drax and Mantis traveled to Knowhere to attempt to stop Thanos from getting the Reality Stone from the Collector. During their journey, Gamora made Quill promise to kill her should Thanos get ahold of her, saying she had information which he could use to destroy the entire universe.

On Knowhere, seemingly finding him before he had the Reality Stone, Gamora fatally stabbed Thanos. When he fell to the ground, asking her why she had done it, she broke down in tears. Thanos revealed he already had the Reality Stone and his �death� was a ruse, noting her reaction had proven she still cared for him. Thanos grabbed Gamora and while Peter initially resisted her pleas to shoot him, he finally went through with his promise to her, wanting to give her agency. However, Thanos used the Reality Stone to turn his blast into mere bubbles, as he teleported away with Gamora.

On his ship, Thanos showed Gamora that he had captured Nebula when she had attempted to kill him. He tortured her in front of Gamora, until Gamora revealed the information she had kept from him�that she knew that the Soul Stone was located on the planet Vormir."
"Thanos and Gamora arrived on Vormir to find the Red Skull, now serving as a guide to the Soul Stone. He informed them that Thanos would have to sacrifice someone he loved to possess the stone. Believing this to be Thanos� undoing, Gamora told Thanos she was thankful she could see the moment when the universe laughed in his face, since he loved no one. When Thanos turned to her with tears in his eyes, Gamora refused to believe what he felt for her was love. However, her own expression changed to one of dread, as he grabbed her by the arm, throwing her off a cliff to her doom. After he killed Gamora, Thanos was indeed granted the Soul Stone.Later, when Thanos gathered all six Infinity Stones, he snapped his fingers and ended half the life in the universe, just as Gamora had feared he would. In the moment he did so, he briefly found himself seeing a vision of the young Gamora he first encountered years before on her planet. She asked him if he succeeded, and when he said he had, she asked what it had cost him. He told the little girl it had cost him everything."
"The Avengers who survived Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet snap worked together on a plan to acquire the Infinity Stones from various points in the past to bring everyone back, though that would not have included Gamora who perished beforehand. Nebula and War Machine traveled to the past to snatch the Power Stone on Morag and succeeded along with the others. However, Nebula discovered that she was sharing a network with her past self, thus feeding information to the Thanos of that era.

The Gamora of the past appeared concerned about Thanos' quest to find the Stones, but kept her thoughts secret. After capturing future Nebula, past Nebula took her place and returned to the present allowing Thanos' ship to fly through the time platform to the future. Once there, Gamora freed Nebula and the two agreed to stop Thanos. Shortly after making Earthfall, they encountered past Nebula who had retrieved the Infinity Gauntlet. Gamora watched as the Nebula of this home era killed her past self.

During the battle, Gamora met Star-Lord who confused her with the one he already knew. When he tried touching her, she knocked him to the ground. From there, she joined the larger fight, working with the other heroes�who had returned via magic portals�to get the Gauntlet where it needed to go. Ultimately, Iron Man used the Stones to snap Thanos and his attackers away. It remains unknown what that move meant for the Gamora of the past, though Quill left Earth still searching for her."
"Also known as Subject 89P13, Rocket is the result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments conducted on Halfworld. Traveling with Groot, his friend and fellow bounty hunter, Rocket accumulated a criminal record with the Nova Corps that includes 13 counts of theft, 22 counts of escape from incarceration, 7 counts of mercenary activity, 15 counts of arson�and a note that he tends to bite.Rocket had escaped 22 prisons by the time he met fellow outlaws Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, and Gamora on Xandar while attempting to claim Quill for the outstanding bounty on his head. In the scuffle that followed, all four attracted the attention of the Nova Corps and were arrested, sending them to a high-security prison. Locked up together, Rocket, Groot, Quill and Gamora�joined by a prisoner named Drax�banded together and escaped. Despite Rocket�s attempts to keep his new allies at arms length, he grew to care for them, fighting alongside them as they became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy."
"Rocket is an expert engineer with genius-level intellect when it comes to constructing high-powered weaponry. He is a genetically and surgically modified lifeform containing a cybernetic skeletal structure, enhanced phalange and metacarpal bones, along with a genetically augmented cerebral cortex. He possesses enhanced strength, durability, agility, and acute senses due to his cybernetic augmentations.Rocket is a master marksman, tactician, pilot, and is multilingual, able to speak with Groot. Despite his small stature, he�s able to pack a punch with the weapons he creates.

His weaponry includes an Ion Cannon, Laser Cannon, Gas Grenade, the Hadron Enforcer combustion cannon, Aero-Rigs�allowing users to jettison into the air and outer space�and a Nanobot Welder."
"Rocket�s enemies include any enemy of the Guardians of the Galaxy, although he has accrued some notable adversaries.

When Radical Kree zealot Ronan the Accuser breaks a peace treaty with the Kree and Xandarians, desiring the destruction of all Xandarians, Rocket engages in a battle with him over an Infinity Stone alongside his fellow Guardians. He blames Ronan for Groot�s death during the confrontation.

The Mad Titan Thanos is immensely strong and cruel and stops at nothing to get ahold of each Infinity Stone in his bid to destroy half the universe. While Rocket does his best to stay out of Thanos� way, Thanos� actions begin to hit increasingly close to home and he earns Rocket�s enmity.

The Sovereign and their High Priestess originally give the Guardians a job to defeat an Abilisk, a creature feeding off their precious Anulax Batteries. Rocket�s theft of some of those same batteries lead the Sovereign to hunt the Guardians.

The Celestial Ego attempts to conquer the universe using his son, Peter Quill, but the Guardians, Rocket included, fight to stop him."
"Rocket has a close bond with Groot, formed before the two joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. After Groot dies, but generates a spawn, that bond carries over, with Rocket continuing to watch out for the young being�even as the adolescent Groot tests his patience.

Rocket has a close bond with Groot, formed before the two joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. After Groot dies, but generates a spawn, that bond carries over, with Rocket continuing to watch out for the young being�even as the adolescent Groot tests his patience.Besides Groot, Rocket fights alongside his fellow outlaws turned Guardians of the Galaxy, Peter Quill, Gamora, and Drax, with Mantis eventually joining the group. While prone to arguments, Rocket still finds close connections with his fellow Guardians, even if he�s reluctant to admit it.

Yondu Udontu straddles the ally and enemy role with the Guardians, but ultimately sides with them. Rocket and Yondu bond over their similar personality traits, including their tendency to push people away to protect themselves.

After the Guardians rescue Thor, the Asgardian Avenger and Rocket form a friendship. Alongside Thor and Groot, Rocket battles alongside several of Thor�s fellow Avengers and other allies. He also quickly sees a potential new score in Bucky Barnes� robotic arm.
"
"After being locked up in the the prison known as the Kyln alongside Groot, Peter Quill, Gamora and fellow prisoner Drax, Rocket planned their escape. Though there were obstacles to overcome, Rocket�s engineering ingenuity proved key in the break out, as he turned off the artificial gravity in the prison, while redirecting the security drones to propel them out of the cell block.To sell the valuable and dangerous Orb Quill had stolen, and to keep it from Ronan, the outlaws traveled to Knowhere. While waiting to meet their intended buyer, the Collector, Drax offended Rocket with his rude name calling, causing a fight to break out between the two that Quill had to break up. Rocket was also upset by the Collector referring to him as a pet, though Gamora intervened. It was the Collector who explained that the Orb housed the Power Stone, one of six incredibly powerful Infinity Stones.

After the sale to the Collector went sour, Rocket, Groot and Drax found themselves separated from Gamora and Quill after simultaneous attacks by Ronan and Yondu, who both sought the Orb. Rocket suggested he and Groot get to the other side of the universe to save themselves, but was convinced by both Groot and Drax to instead help his newfound friends. After the outlaws were reunited, Quill begged them all to help him make a stand against Ronan, though Rocket suggested that, given the odds, Quill was asking them to die. Gamora, Groot, and Drax decided to support Quill, with Rocket finally reluncantly agreeing as well.

Putting aside their grievences to work with both Yondu and his Ravagers and the Nova Corps, the group�soon dubbed the Guardians of the Galaxy by Ronan as a jest�confronted Ronan and his army on Xandar, with Rocket initially providing crucial air support. When Ronan grabbed Drax by the throat, Rocket flew his ship into Ronan�s craft, the Dark Aster, sending the Aster careening towards the ground. Despite Rocket�s protests, Groot enveloped his friends in his protective branches, absorbing the impact, but causing his own death."
"When Quill needed help harnessing the Power Stone, Rocket joined hands with Quill, Gamora, and Drax, and the teammates were able to defeat Ronan. In the aftermath, Rocket, mourning his friend, planted one of the twigs remaining from Groot�s sacrifice, only for that planting to sprout into a new spawn of Groot.

The Guardians were hired soon after by the the Sovereign and their High Priestess Ayesha to stop a creature feeding off their home planet�s power source, valuable Anulax Batteries. The Guardians were successful, but Rocket stole some of the prized batteries, sending the Sovereign after them on a quest for revenge."
"When the Sovereign attacked, the Guardians were saved thanks to the intervention of Quill�s father, the Celestial known as Ego. While Quill, Gamora, and Drax accompanied Ego and his servant, Mantis, to Ego�s planet, Rocket and Groot, along with their prisoner, Nebula, stayed behind while Rocket worked to repair the Milano.

Yondu and his Ravagers arrived to secure the stolen batteries for themselves and ended up battling Rocket, who managed to incapacitate many of his foes before being taken prisoner�along with Yondu himself�as a mutiny began against him. With the help of Groot and the Ravager Kraglin, Rocket and Yondu broke out of their cell, decimating the traitorous Ravagers who�d turned on Yondu, before heading out to reunite with Quill and the others."
"During their journey, Yondu called out Rocket for being just like him, pushing everyone away so that he�s not reminded of the love he lacks and feels he doesn�t deserve. As they bonded over their similarities, Yondu agreed to overcome his own fears and confront Ego, whose dark intentions masked his friendly demeanor.

Joined by Mantis, Nebula, Yondu and Kraglin, the Guardians were successful in their bid to stop Ego�s plan to take over the universe though his so-called �expansion,� with a bomb Rocket fashioned powered by the stolen Anulax batteries, playing a key role. When it became clear Yondu was willing to sacrifice himself to save Quill from Ego�s dying planet, Rocket regretfully gave him the only remaining space suit and aero-rig to help him in his quest. Moments later, Rocket stunned Gamora, who was going to try and return to the surface to get Quill, saying that he couldn�t lose any more friends in the same day. After Yondu�s death, and his subsequent Ravagers funeral�with old compatriots who�d long rejected him honoring him once more�Rocket cried for the friend he�d made and lost."
"Years later, the Guardians of the Galaxy answered a distress call that led to their discovery of Thor, the only apparent survivor of a destroyed spaceship. After Thor explained his people had been decimated by Thanos, who now had two of the Infinity Stones, Gamora warned that should Thanos get all six of the stones, he could end life in half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. When Thor revealed he intended to travel to Nidavellir to have a new weapon forged to battle Thanos, Rocket volunteered himself and Groot to accompany the god of thunder.

Forming a quick rapport, Thor and Rocket�s bond was strengthed on their trip to Nidavellir as Thor opened up to Rocket about all of the personal loss he�d gone through. Rocket ended up gifting Thor, who�d recently lost an eye in battle, with a new robotic eye he�d stolen during his travels. Upon arriving at Nidavellir, the trio met the Dwarf Eitri, the only survivor there after Thanos had the Dwarves build him his Infinity Gauntlet and then wiped them out. Rocket, using the ship they�d flown to Nidavellir, did his part to assist Eitri and Thor in the creation of the mighty axe known as Stormbreaker, with Groot sacrificing his own arm to forge the handle."
"With Stormbreaker capable of opening the Bifrost, Rocket accompanied Thor and Groot to Earth, joining the battle fought by Black Panther, his Wakandan forces, and several Avengers members and allies against Thanos� legion of followers. On the battlefield, Rocket admired Bucky Barnes� gun and robotic arm, hoping to add them to his own collection.

With Thor�s crucial help, the tide of the battle seemed to be going in the heroes� favor, but Thanos� arrival quickly changed everything. When the villain gained possession of the Mind Stone from Vision, he had all six of the Infinity Stones, and even Stormbreaker could not stop him. Thanos snapped his fingers, doing what Gamora had warned them of, and instantly ended half the life in the universe. Crying out �No� repeatedly, Rocket watched helplessly as Groot vanished into nothingness, along with many others on the battlefield.

Alongside the equally stunned Thor, Black Widow, War Machine, Bruce Banner and Captain America, Rocket stood in disbelief over what had just occurred."
"Having survived Thanos' snap, Rocket made his way from Wakanda to the Avengers Compound in New York. He was there to comfort Nebula when she and Iron Man were delivered to Earth by Captain Marvel. Rocket helped chart the course the group took to find Thanos on the planet he dubbed The Garden. There, the Titan explained that he had used the Infinity Stones to destroy themselves. Thor killed Thanos in a rage.

Some time later, Rocket returned to space with Nebula. They did their best to help out where they could, answering distress calls and reporting back to Black Widow and the Avengers on Earth. Five years after Thanos' death, the Avengers began developing a plan to travel through time to acquire the Infinity Stones and bring back everyone they lost. Rocket and Nebula flew in to help."
"Needing all the help they could get, Hulk and Rocket traveled to New Asgard to recruit Thor who was treating his deep depression with copious amounts of alcohol. The Asgardian finally agreed to come along after Rocket noted they had beer in the ship. Back at Avengers headquarters, Rocket assisted in the building of the time platform and explained that the Power Stone was on Morag in the past.

With everything set and assignments given out, Rocket and Thor traveled to Asgard in the past to attain the Reality Stone�also known as the Aether�which had been absorbed by Jane Foster. The Odinson grew worried and Rocket gave him a tough love pep talk that proved less than effective. While Thor had a talk with his mother Frigga, Rocket snuck into Foster's chambers and used an extractor device to attain the Infinity Stone. He was detected by palace guards and ran to his partner. The pair returned to the present without further problems."
"Having succeeded in their mission, the Avengers got to work putting together a new Infinity Gauntlet, which Rocket assisted with, even cracking jokes during the most tense moments. Hulk utilized the new glove to successfully bring everyone back, but the Nebula from the past had taken the modern version's place and used the time platform to let her Thanos through. He launched an attack on the compound, leading to its utter destruction. Rocket was caught under debris, but War Machine helped get him out while Hulk help up a mountain of rubble. Ultimately, they were saved by Ant-Man, who grew huge, giving them an escape route.

By that point, portals had opened bringing heroes from all over to push back against Thanos' forces, including Rocket's fellow Guardians. During the fight, Rocket even reunited with his pal Bucky Barnes. To defeat Thanos, Stark used the Infinity Gauntlet, but it killed him. Rocket mourned his friend along with the rest of his team at the memorial and then headed back to space, this time with Thor tagging along."
"Thor eventually left the Guardians to deal with Gorr the God-Butcher and the Guardians carried on answering distress calls. They gained a more permanent home after purchasing Knowhere. Rocket and the others helped make repairs after the damaged done by Thanos during his quest for the Infinity Stones years prior.

Around Christmastime, Drax and Mantis hatched a plan to sneak off to Earth and retrieve Kevin Bacon, so they could give him to Quill as a present. They succeeded in their mission and also filled the ship with holiday decorations that Rocket and the others set up while Peter was busy. Star-Lord loved the gesture, but did not like that they kidnapped Bacon. Upon regaining his senses, Kevin called Rocket a raccoon and the furry Guardian lunged to attack him. Luckily Groot was there to hold Rocket back.

After calming down, Kevin Bacon agreed to hang out for a bit to spread holiday cheer. During the celebration, Nebula gave Rocket a gift: Bucky's arm. Rocket even tried to carry on the Christmas spirit by decorating Groot with Cosmo, though that idea ultimately failed."
"Sentient and ambulatory plant-being Groot left his Flora colossus people behind on their native Planet X to travel out into the galaxy. Both before and after meeting the genetically enhanced creature known as Rocket, Groot racked up an impressive list of criminal charges from the Nova Corps police force while working for crime lords in various capacities.

Together, Groot and Rocket finally concentrated on being bounty hunters, a job that took them to many exotic worlds. Upon tracking Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, to Xandar for the bounty on his head, Groot and Rocket ran afoul of the assassin Gamora and wound up arrested by the Nova Corps. They were incarcerated in the Kyln prison complex alongside Quill and Gamora, where they also met the warrior Drax.They teamed up with their fellow inmates to fence the Orb, a mysterious artifact that Quill claimed could be sold for immense wealth if Groot and the others would help him escape lock-up."
"Composed of matter resembling that of wood and possessing a fully functioning brain system, Groot can �grow� most anything he needs at any given time from his body, such as weapons for fighting, protective barriers for himself or others, and even flowers to give to special someones. Not usually overly talkative, he communicates with what appears to be a single phrase, �I am Groot,� but which can be translated to mean a multitude of things, as if stated in a full language format.Normally placid and friendly, Groot can handle himself well in combat and use deadly force if he feels the situation warrants it, and most especially if anyone endangers Rocket or his fellow Guardians of the Galaxy. In fact, in those moments, Groot can be called fierce and frightening.

One of his greatest abilities is his ability to survive immense damage or even mortal injury by �regrowing� himself from even a small shard of his former self. During this reformative time, Groot follows a growth cycle similar to humans, from infant to adolescent and finally to adulthood, with each stage bringing with it evolving intelligence and temperament levels."
"When provoked or threatened, Groot transforms from peaceful tree-person into a mighty warrior with a hint of savagery�characteristics he exhibits regardless of what age he appears to be. As a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot joins the fight against cosmic threats like Ronan and Ego, and eventually Thanos and his followers.On a more personal level, the baby incarnation of Groot exacts his vengeance on the Ravager named Retch for abuses delivered by Retch during Groot�s brief tenure as the forced �mascot� of the pirates."
"Rocket stands as Groot�s closest companion and buddy, with all that such a relationship brings with it. Though the almost-raccoon often times seems frustrated or even irritable with the tree-being, they are in fact deeply aware of each other�s needs and feelings.

Groot also apparently treasures his friendship and camaraderie with the other members of the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora and Peter Quill, the two of them often acting as parental figures after Groot is reborn in a baby-like form.While at first showing indifference to the Asgardian Thor, Groot ultimately comes to his aid at a crucial point, and fights alongside him and other Avengers and close allies of that Earth-bound team.

Beyond his immediate circle of friends, Groot gravitates to the downtrodden he encounters in his travels, especially children."
"After escaping the Kyln, Groot traveled with Rocket and his new friends to the asteroid called Knowhere to meet the Collector, to whom Quill hoped to sell the Orb. Instead, Ronan the Kree Accuser captured the Orb, which housed an Infinity Stone, prompting Groot to urge Rocket to move to save his new comrades and follow the trail of the Stone. That path led them back to Xandar, where the band of friends made their way onto Ronan�s ship to try to recapture their lost artifact. Groot fought Ronan�s troops valiantly, and when the ship started to lose orbit and crash into Xandar, he formed a protective capsule out of his own body to ensure everyone would survive the impact. Sadly, he himself did not survive the crash, but when Rocket and the others finished their battle with Ronan, Groot began to regrow into a new life from a stick of his former existence."
"Not long after, the infant Groot traveled with his friends, now called the Guardians of the Galaxy, to complete a mission for the alien Sovereign race�though Rocket�s theft of valuable batteries from the Sovereign and the ensuing chase led to a crash land on a remote planet. When Quill, Gamora, and Drax left with Quill�s long-lost father, Ego, Rocket and Groot stayed behind for Rocket to fix the ship. They encountered Yondu Udonta�s Ravagers, who took the duo onto their ship and into captivity, while locking Yondu himself up following a mutiny. Abused by the crew, the little Groot, assisted by remorseful Ravager Kraglin, helped Rocket and Yondu escape to return to the company of their friends on Ego�s world.

With Ego revealed as not only having been responsible for the death of Quill�s mother, but to have a terrifying �expansion� planned, which would turn the entire universe into an extension of himself, Rocket designed a bomb intended to blow up Ego�s consciousness at the core of the planet. While his friends fought both Ego and the returning Sovereign, Groot was tasked with delivering the explosive package to the core, a mission he readily accepted and, overcoming many questions about his ability to correctly remember what to do, carried out with success. Upon reaching the surface again, he learned of Yondu�s noble sacrifice to save Quill and later witnessed his moving funeral.  In the years that followed, Groot continued to grow and upon reaching what would be adolescence for his race he entered into a period of sullenness and some slight rebellion against his fellow Guardians. Obsessed with a hand-held video game, Groot almost completely ignored his team�s plight against the tyrant Thanos, even as he accompanied Rocket and the Asgardian Thor to Nidavellir on a quest to forge a new weapon for the god of thunder. However, with Thor�s life on the line, when the Asgardian needed a stout handle for his newly forged magical axe, Stormbreaker, Groot gave his own arm to provide the weapon�s handle, an act that brought him some pain.
Traveling through the Bifrost with Thor and Rocket to Earth, Groot landed in the African nation of Wakanda in the middle of a sprawling clash between Wakandan forces, many of Earth�s heroes, and Thanos� army of followers. Groot destroyed many of Thanos� forces, and even engaged Thanos himself when the tyrant suddenly appeared to end the fight and capture the last of the six Infinity When Thanos achieved that goal, he snapped his fingers and willed all six Stones to obliterate half of all sentient life in the universe. As Rocket looked on in anguish, Groot was among those who disintegrated away"
"Five years later, Groot and the others who had been unmade all returned thanks to the efforts of the Avengers. Groot entered the battle against the time-traveling Thanos alongside his allies from Wakanda. Groot and the others bought Iron Man enough time to use the Infinity Stones to expel the invading forces, but he lost his life in the process. After Stark's wake, the Guardians returned to space, this time with Thor along for the ride.

The Asgardian eventually left the squad to deal with Gorr and the Guardians began setting down roots on Knowhere, which they purchased from the Collector. By Christmastime, Groot had become noticeably wider in the shoulders as he continued growing back to adult size. After Mantis and Drax traveled to Earth to attain not just holiday decorations, but also Quill's hero Kevin Bacon, Groot assisted in secretly decorating the area.

Groot even rolled out the box containing Bacon, but Quill was upset about the kidnapping. Ultimately, the Earth star agreed to bring Knowhere some holiday cheer. During the gift exchange, Groot received a Gameboy from Quill and gave his friends dioramas he made featuring them. After Bacon was taken home, Rocket and Cosmo tried decorating Groot like a Christmas tree, but Groot had other ideas."
"Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes� military enlistment, and undeterred by his own multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men to fight for their country in the dark days of World War II. Rogers� valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the Army�s Super-Soldier program under his supervision. Though Rogers learned of Erskine�s disastrous previous attempts to realize a super-soldier, Germany�s so-called �Red Skull,� he braved the process and emerged from it a new man. With a powerful body and heightened speed and reflexes, Rogers faced his first challenge when forced to chase down Dr. Erskine�s assassin immediately following the experiment. In doing so, he also learned of the involvement of Hydra, the Nazi science division, in the doctor�s murder.The Army moved swiftly to create a colorful, star-spangled persona for Steve Rogers they called �Captain America,� and put him on a tour to sell war bonds. Chafing at what he felt was inaction, Rogers jumped at the chance to join the real fighting when he received news of the capture of his friend Barnes� army division and rushed to rescue the soldiers. Upon the successful completion of the unplanned mission�and a brief meeting with the Red Skull himself�Rogers determined his path as a one-man fighting force."
"As Captain America, Steve Rogers carries a nearly indestructible shield fashioned from the rare Wakandan metal known as vibranium. Designed and crafted by genius inventor Howard Stark during World War II, the shield is a perfectly balanced instrument capable of withstanding intense stress and damage, yet also able to be thrown as an offensive weapon that rebounds back to its owner. Rogers maintains the shield as an almost constant companion after it was recovered from the wreckage of the Red Skull�s airplane, as it has become a symbol of strength to all those who recognize Captain America as the country�s defender.Rogers is also well-versed in the use of firearms, though he rarely carries or uses them in modern times. His famous Captain America suit and helmet have been updated more than once since the 1940s, and offers him some protection against the elements and enemies alike."
"Steve Rogers� first real enemy took the form of Johann Schmidt, a German scientist and wartime leader of the Nazi science division, Hydra. Schmidt became known as the Red Skull after a failed attempt to augment himself using Dr. Erskine�s super-soldier serum devolved his features into a crimson, skull-like countenance. His obsession with power led him to gain possession of the Tesseract, an otherworldly power source of unparalleled energy, and split off of Hydra from Hitler�s forces. The Red Skull met his match, though, in Captain America. The hero dogged the villain throughout the war until Schmidt�s apparent demise in his own aircraft high above the North Atlantic.Arnim Zola, a scientist under the Red Skull�s command, managed to survive the war by supposedly allying himself with the allies and the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D.; but in reality, he kept the dream of Hydra alive all the while. When his own death approached, Zola transferred his consciousness into a S.H.I.E.L.D. computer to continue to be a thorn in Captain America�s side in the present.

Other modern-day menaces for Steve Rogers include Asgardian god of mischief Loki, mercenary and martial artist Georges Batroc, and weapons dealer Brock Rumlow, AKA Crossbones.

Captain America has also come face to face with the fearsome threat of Thanos, doing all he can to stop the Titan in his quest to end half the life in the universe."
"Steve Rogers� forthright attitude and positive disposition has attracted a select group of people into his inner circle of friends. His longest companion is James Buchanan �Bucky� Barnes, who Rogers met in his Hell�s Kitchen neighborhood in New York and formed a close friendship with. Despite Barnes� enlistment in the Army and Rogers� career as Captain America during the war, the two found each other and united to form a solid battlefront against the Axis. When Barnes seemingly fell to his death, Steve Rogers felt as if a brother had been taken from him.Though his time with Peggy Carter was comparatively short to his friendship with Bucky Barnes, Rogers� feelings toward the capable young woman had begun to blossom into romance before his crash into the Atlantic. The two reunited in the present day, but Carter�s advanced age and her weakening health prevented them from continuing what they�d begun during the war. Regardless, Rogers maintained his connection with the woman until her death from natural causes and looks forward to what the future may bring with his relationship to Sharon Carter, Peggy�s great-niece and S.H.I.E.L.D.�s Agent 13.

Through their partnership in the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff have formed a friendship, something the infamous Black Widow does not offer lightly. Despite moments of Rogers� distrust of Romanoff�s decisions and her prodding of him to fully embrace the modern world, an underlying understanding exists between the two heroes.Captain America has also formed a bond with Sam Wilson, known as the Falcon, who has shown intense loyalty to Rogers. His relationship with Iron Man Tony Stark remains a difficult one to categorize, given the rift the two have had."
"After truly joining the fight in World War II thanks to his rescue of captured troops, including his old friend Bucky Barnes, Captain America quickly earned the respect and admiration. And it was not only from the soldiers he fought alongside, but also from British secret agent Peggy Carter, an expert on Hydra, who had served as Erskine�s assistant on the Super-Soldier program. After a series of battles overseas, Rogers, Barnes, and the Howling Commandos strike force staged an assault on a train carrying Hydra personnel, during which Barnes seemingly fell to his death. Grieving over the loss, Rogers nevertheless continued his campaign against Hydra, while also growing closer to Peggy.Captain America took the fight directly to the Red Skull when he led an invasion of the villain�s base in an all-out attempt to break Hydra�s hold on the war. Rogers successfully boarded the Skull�s aircraft as it took off to launch an attack on the United States. But, when his foe�s powerful Tesseract energy source spelled the Red Skull�s doom, the Super-Soldier found himself with no other alternative then to purposefully crash the plane to stop its pre-programmed drive toward America. While Peggy Carter listened through radio communications with the aircraft, Steve Rogers took it down into the icy North Atlantic waters and apparently to his death.Instead, Captain America entered into a state of suspended animation after the crash, and was recovered in the present day by S.H.I.E.L.D., the successor to Peggy Carter�s Strategic Scientific Reserve. Awakened, he learned of his current status and began the long journey to acclimating to a brand-new, modern world.

Almost immediately upon Steve Roger�s revival in the present, he was offered a spot in Nick Fury�s Avengers Initiative and took his place among other heroes, including Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. The group first came together to battle Thor�s brother Loki. However, their initial teamwork was marred by internal strife, chiefly between Rogers and Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, the son of Rogers� old wartime companion, Howard. The team eventually finally truly came together in the wake of their colleague Phil Coulson�s death at the hands of Loki."
"In the ensuing battle in New York between the Avengers and Loki and his alien forces, Captain America took charge as a natural leader, coming up with an on-the-spot plan to contain the fight as much as possible to help innocent civilians escape. Loki was defeated. While the Avengers parted ways for the time being, the group had developed mutual respect for one another, as well as the desire to maintain the team when they were needed to address larger threats.

After filming a series of Public Service Announcements on different subjects for high school students, Captain America continued to acclimate to modern times and forged friendships with fellow Avenger Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow and a USAF operative named Sam Wilson. Rogers was spending much of his time assisting S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field.

Both Romanoff and Wilson aided him when it was discovered that Hydra had long ago infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Rogers was on the run after an attempt to silence him. Rogers found another ally in Sharon Carter, an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent he would later learn was Peggy Carter�s great niece. At this time, Rogers also discovered his old friend Bucky Barnes had not in fact died during World War II, but became a brainwashed sleeper agent and assassin for Hydra called the Winter Soldier. In the midst of stopping Hydra�s nefarious �Project Insight� program, Cap and Bucky battled, and Cap�s pleas to his old friend to remember who he was finally seemed to succeed, as Bucky saved Rogers from drowning, though he vanished in the aftermath. Re-teaming with the Avengers to take out remaining Hydra cells brought Roger�s into contact with the enhanced siblings Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, as the Avengers retrieved the powerful staff Loki had used in his attempt to conquer Earth. After Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the staff to help create a free-thinking robot called Ultron, only for Ultron to turn on humanity, Rogers took Stark to task over the situation, setting off a deep-seated disagreement between the two men. The Avengers, now joined by a regretful Wanda and Pietro, faced off with Ultron in the small nation of Sokovia, and although they defeated the robot, they failed to prevent the loss of Pietro or the devastation of the Sokovian people and their community.Leading a new lineup of the Avengers, Captain America continued his work to fight criminals around the globe. But, when several innocents died during a confrontation with Cap�s enemy, Brock Rumlow, it set off a chain reaction that resulted in a United Nations-backed program called the Sokovia Accords, which would be used to register and control the actions of super humans and costumed champions. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark grappled with opposite opinions on the matter, with Rogers firmly against the concept of the Accords, which in turn led to the Avengers and various other heroes taking sides in the growing conflict. In the midst of this, Steve also had to deal with the death of the now-elderly Peggy Carter and was reunited with Sharon, who once again covertly helped him, while the two took tentative steps towards a romance.

During these events, Bucky also resurfaced after a lethal bomb was set off during a United Nation gathering over the Accords and the Winter Soldier was framed for the horrific act. The victims of that bombing included Wakanda's king, T�Chaka, leading his son, Prince T�Challa, the Black Panther, to seek revenge against Barnes. Inevitably, the tensions between Cap and his friends and their former teammates turned physical, with T�Challa among those fighting with Stark, as Rogers strove to protect Barnes and find the real culprit."
"A truce was briefly called when Rogers and Stark both discovered the bombing was actually caused by Helmut Zemo, a Sokovian who lost his family during the Avengers battle against Ultron. However, the situation escalated again when Stark, as part of Zemo�s insidious plan to destroy the Avengers, learned that it was Barnes who had killed his parents years before and that Rogers had kept the information from him. In a bitter fight between Iron Man and Captain America, Rogers managed to eventually subdue Stark and walked away from the Avengers completely, leaving his shield behind. However, he sent Tony a message soon after, explaining his regrets over what had happened and letting Tony know he would be there for him should the need arise, leaving Stark a phone he could use to contact him if need be.

After breaking out the heroes who�d fought alongside him against Stark�s crew�and been imprisoned as a result�Steve Rogers accompanied Bucky Barnes to the technologically advanced nation of Wakanda to seek the aid of T�Challa, who also had learned of Barnes� innocence in his father�s death. The Black Panther agreed to help his former foes, assuring Captain America it would be far from easy for any who may learn of Barnes� presence in Wakanda and attempt to strike at him there.

For the next two years, Rogers remained on the run, staying in close contact with fellow fugitives Romanoff, Wilson, and Maximoff. Rogers eventually came out of hiding when Bruce Banner used the phone he�d left Stark to make contact, informing Rogers of the impending threat of Thanos, who was hunting for Vision�s mind stone. In Scotland, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson arrived in time to help fend off an attack against Maximoff and Vision by Thanos� agents."
"Briefly returning to Avengers headquarters in upstate New York, Rogers refused to accept Vision�s offer to have the mind stone destroyed knowing it would lead to Vision�s death. When it was suggested by Banner that there may be a way to remove the stone but keep Vision alive, Rogers once more sought help from T�Challa and the advanced science of Wakanda.In Wakanda, Rogers and several fellow Avengers and allies, including Bucky, joined forces with T�Challa and his people to fight an army of Thanos� followers, hoping to hold them off long enough for the stone to successfully be removed and destroyed. Despite their valiant effort, Thanos was able to gain possession of the mind stone, ripping it from Vision�s head and leaving him lifeless. Using his Infinity Gauntlet, now powered by all six infinity stones, Thanos snapped his fingers and extinguished half the life in the universe in one fell swoop. Rogers helplessly watched as many around him, including Bucky and other close friends, disintegrated before his eyes."
"Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark�s weaponry business after his parents� untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Stark�s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen�who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark�s chest�would prolong it temporarily.

Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors."
"With help from his friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes, the inventor returned home and promptly announced Stark Industries departure from the weapons business. His personal assistant Pepper Potts backed the sudden course reversal, but his father�s old friend and business partner, Obadiah Stane, strongly disagreed with what he saw as a rash decision.

Stark worked overtime in his lab to streamline the armor, and when he�d finished, a new persona emerged: Iron Man. After he discovered Stane had illegally sold Stark weapons to the Ten Rings, he donned the armor to return to Afghanistan and stop the group from using them. Later, he also learned that Stane had paid the Ten Rings to kill him and had been working behind Stark�s back to steal the entire company. The older man then forcibly took the RT from Tony�s chest and left his old friend�s son to die. But, Potts helped Stark insert his original, cobbled-together RT into his chest, and Iron Man flew again.

Stane presented himself in a gigantic suit of armor of his own, and a battle ensued until Stark and Potts overloaded Stane�s power source and Stane died in the process. Feeling more confident in himself than ever before, Stark called a press conference soon after the fight and impulsively announced to the world that he was indeed Iron Man.

"
"At the very core of the Iron Man technology lies the Arc Reactor. Designed by Howard Stark, but augmented and strengthened by Tony Stark, the Reactor provides a clean, manageable energy source with incredible output, one that can be adapted to most anything. At first a large piece of equipment, the younger Stark miniaturized the technology into the �RT,� which was the size of a human heart, and put it to great use to power his suits of armor. Iron Man�s armor provided a complete working environment for its user, including enhanced strength, closed air systems, data input, communications, flight, defense systems, and offensive weaponry such as missiles, lasers, and so-called �repulsor� technology. Stark never stops in his advancement of his armor designs, and at one time created multiple versions, each one of them with a specialized use. The armor has also become lighter and more flexible since the first incarnation, allowing Stark to �suit up� in mere seconds and be immediately ready for action.

Stark�s latest suit was destroyed in battle with the tyrant Thanos, but while in use sported maximum thrust for flight, new offensive weapons, and nanotechnology that allowed near instantaneous application."
"Many of Tony Stark�s enemies have stepped out from the shadows to reveal themselves as people connected to him in some personal way, making for even tougher challenges for Iron Man.

Obadiah Stane fools Stark and nearly everyone around him with his vocal desire to see Stark Industries, his old friend�s business, succeed and grow. That desire leads to selfish pursuits and the belief that Howard Stark�s son would serve Stane�s purposes better dead than alive. His own intellect and scientific prowess provide him with the means to build the gigantic �Iron Monger� suit, but his hubris leads to his defeat and demise."
"Justin Hammer first appears on the scene as a business rival of Stark�s, and swiftly proves himself unreliable, as well as harboring criminal tendencies, like Aldrich Killian after him. They stand as two men who could have helped the world to become a better place, but instead fed their own passions and brought an ending to their respective stories through their own missteps. Ivan Vanko lusts for revenge on the Starks for what he sees as injustices heaped upon his own father, making him something of a darker version of Tony Stark.

In Loki, Thor�s adoptive brother, Stark encounters a foe who seems to wield magic instead of science, something that is at odds with the inventor�s entire make-up. To counteract this internal dilemma, Stark confronts Loki with his trademark wit and bravado.

Ultron represents Stark�s hubris in physical form�a robot created by him. Ultron almost immediately advances itself past its creator to become Stark�s nightmare: technology he can�t control. Though he and the Avengers manage to defeat Ultron, the scars from its birth still show on Stark, perhaps forever.

More recently, Thanos the tyrant from Titan dominates Stark�s list of enemies and proves to be more than a match for the man�s genius and armored strength."
"Some of Tony Stark�s closest friends, allies, and associates are people he works with.

Pepper Potts began as Stark�s personal assistant. She quickly proves her value to him by essentially making sure he survives each day as the owner of Stark Industries, therefore earning his trust to step into the role of CEO. On a personal level, the two develop deep feelings for each other that grows into a romance for the ages. Tony Stark cannot see his life as anything without Pepper Potts, and he hopes to prove it every single day they�re together, through thick and thin.Happy Hogan is also an employee that earned his boss� trust, first as his chauffeur and then as Stark�s head of security. Hogan can often exhibit an overzealous nature when it comes to what he sees as taking care of Stark, but he would take a bullet for the man and has. The same is true of James Rhodes, who wears a version of the Iron Man suit as War Machine/Iron Patriot and has at times been the liaison between Stark Industries and the U.S. military. He and Stark�s friendship dates back to their attendance at M.I.T., and it has grown into a partnership beyond a common background to mutual admiration, even when each sees the other at their worst."
"In the Super Hero community, perhaps the closest friend Tony Stark has is Steve Rogers, Captain America. Tony and Steve have had notable ups and down�And even come to blows�and often have differing opinions on how best to serve the world community. However, the two men share a strong figure in their histories, Howard Stark, and they both possess notable devotion to tasks at hand.

Tony has also found himself serving as a mentor to Peter Parker, the teenage Super Hero known as Spider-Man. Beyond giving the young man updated tech and suits, Tony finds himself dispensing advice to Peter about how to best forge his path as a hero and feels protective towards him."
"Immediately after Tony Stark�s admission of being Iron Man, he was approached by S.H.I.E.L.D.�s Nick Fury and informed of something called the Avengers Initiative, a program to bring together unique individuals for the common good.

Now a worldwide superstar as Iron Man, Stark attracted the attention of Ivan Vanko, whose father supposedly worked on the Arc Reactor with Howard Stark, but died a broken man in Russia. Vanko sought revenge on the Stark family and utilizing a Reactor of his own construction went to America to attack Tony Stark. Dodging government pressure to hand over the secrets of his armor�s technology and poisoned by the RT�s core element, Iron Man won a battle against Vanko and believed any danger from the man to be over.

Stark named Pepper Potts as the new CEO of Stark Industries so he could devote more time to working on new technology. Potts installed Natalie Rushman as his new personal assistant and began to worry over Stark�s erratic behavior due to the poisoning. Luckily, Stark discovered that his father has created a new element and used it to clean up RT�s deficiencies. Meanwhile, business rival Justin Hammer used Vanko to build suits of armor with which he planned to destroy Stark; but Iron Man and James Rhodes, in his own �War Machine� armor, clashed with Vanko and won the day.

In the aftermath of the tribulations, Stark made Potts aware of his feelings for her. Nick Fury also told Stark that he�d only be considered as a consultant to the Avengers Initiative, not an actual participant."
"Soon after, ordered by the World Security Council to try and recruit the imprisoned Emil Blonsky for Fury�s fledgling team, S.H.I.E.L.D. purposely sabotaged the attempt. They sent Stark to approach General Thaddeus �Thunderbolt� Ross to tell him such a team was being formed, and to ask for Blonsky�s release�correctly guessing Stark�s personality would strongly clash with Ross�.

Stark�s consultant status was upgraded when Loki, the Asgardian god of mischief, gained a powerful artifact called the Tesseract and threatened the Earth with it. Stark joined with World War II Super-Soldier Captain America, Loki�s brother Thor, the rampaging Hulk, and S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives Black Widow and Hawkeye to form the Avengers as a bulwark against Loki�s advance."
"At first, the Avengers worked uneasily as a team due to Stark�s strong personality and Captain America�s desire for more traditional heroics, but when Loki�s dealings with an extraterrestrial race of aliens brought about a full-scale alien invasion of New York, Iron Man fought as valiantly as his fellow Avengers. He even saved the day by transporting a U.S. nuclear missile through the aliens� gateway to Earth and blowing up their ship. Later, the heroes celebrated their victory quietly by sharing a meal at a small Manhattan eatery."
"Unfortunately, Tony Stark developed post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the invasion of New York, a situation which created stress in his relationship with Pepper Potts. This was followed by a series of terrorist attacks by a mysterious figure known as the Mandarin, as well as a direct assault on Stark�s home and lab. Without the use of his armor, Stark went alone to discover the Mandarin�s secrets and stumbled upon a crooked scientist-businessman named Aldrich Killian and a kind of super-soldier-like experimental process called Extremis.

When Potts was kidnapped by Killian and injected with Extremis herself, Stark called in his small army of auto-pilot armor suits to battle and defeat Killian and his forces and save the love of his life. Afterward, he underwent surgery to remove the shrapnel from near his heart, destroyed all of his armor, and tried to put Iron Man behind him for good.

Avengers duties brought Stark back to don the armor and help wipe out Hydra across the globe. One team mission to Sokovia plunged the inventor into a nightmare vision of destruction courtesy of the Scarlet Witch, which in turn led Stark to enlist Bruce Banner in the creation of Ultron�a fully functional, autonomous robot. Ultron was born desiring exactly what Stark created him to defend against, human annihilation, feeding arguments between Steve Rogers and Stark about Tony�s actions."
"The Scarlet Witch prodded the Hulk to rampage through the city of Johannesburg in South Africa, forcing Stark to use his �Hulkbuster� armor to stop him. Further actions from Ultron brought the team together again for a united front. But, the robots� devastating assault on a Sokovia brought more changes to Stark�s outlook on the Avengers and Iron Man; when the dust cleared, he retired from active duty on the team.

Not helped by his constant push and pull regarding donning his armor, Tony and Pepper split up. Meanwhile, tensions grew worse between Iron Man and Captain America when the U.S. enacted the Sokovia Accords to register and enlist �enhanced individuals� for the government. Stark backed the accords, perhaps as a balm for his own troubled soul, while Steve Rogers vehemently opposed them. Rogers� old friend Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed �Winter Soldier,� resurfaced and seemingly killed the visiting Wakandan king, T�Chaka, creating even more strife amongst the Avengers when Stark backed the manhunt for Barnes.

A battle between two teams of Avengers (and their allies) occurred at an airport, with Stark and the officially sanctioned group on one side and Captain America and his rogue agents on the other. During the violent clash, Stark�s good friend James Rhodes was seriously injured, and Iron Man put even more effort into bringing in Rogers."
"Discovering T�Chaka�s death was actually caused by the vengeful Sokovian Helmut Zemo, Tony briefly worked with Captain America and Bucky to stop Zemo, only for Zemo to reveal the Winter Soldier�s role in the death of Stark�s parents many years earlier. Driven by rage towards both Barnes and Rogers�the latter of whom had hidden the truth from him�Iron Man bitterly fought both men. But, Captain America gained the upper hand and incapacitated Stark�s armor with his shield. Fleeing the base with Barnes, Rogers left his shield�created by Stark�s father during World War II�behind and freed his compatriots from a government prison. Tony Stark returned to his friend Rhodes�s side and provided him with high tech leg braces in order to help him walk again.

Subsequently, Stark continued to mentor a teenage hero he�d recruited for the airport battle: Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man. When the young man unsuccessfully clashed with a criminal called the Vulture in New York City, Iron Man flew in to stop the Staten Island Ferry from sinking, saving the passengers onboard. Iron Man chastised Spider-Man in the wake of this near-tragedy, taking back the advanced suit he�d given him. Stark wanted to help and protect Peter, and eventually the teenager began to improve and show growth. Spider-Man ultimately turned down both Stark�s invitation to join the Avengers and an even more upgraded suit that had been made for him, though Tony did return the previously designed suit to Peter to acknowledge his accomplishments."
"In the meantime, Tony, having reconciled with Pepper, finally proposed to her and they prepared to announce their engagement to the world.

Sometime later, Stark answered a summons from Doctor Strange and Bruce Banner, learning of Thanos� intention to acquire both of the Infinity Stones known to be on Earth. Iron Man fought valiantly when Thanos� followers attacked New York and managed to get onboard their ship as it left the planet following the assault. The craft made its way to the tyrant�s home world Titan where Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man made a stand alongside Guardians of the Galaxy members Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis to stop Thanos once and for all�eventually joined in their fight by Thanos� adoptive daughter, Nebula. The attempt failed. During the battle Iron Man was badly injured by Thanos and would have lost his life, if not for the intervention of Strange, who gave up the Infinity Stone he had in his possession in order to convince Thanos to spare Stark. The exchange made, Thanos left Titan for Earth, where he was able to gain control of the final Infinity Stone. Having done so, he used the full power of the Infinity Gauntlet to end half of all life in the universe. On Titan, Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man all disintegrated away, leaving the despairing Iron Man and Nebula alone on the planet."
"Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills in a Russian facility called the Red Room. There she honed the skills that would turn her into a human warrior who continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers, Asgardians and people in armored suits. However, she eventually eschewed her KGB masters, switched allegiances and began working for the good guys."
"Exhibiting no super human abilities, the Black Widow boasts ultimate human levels of strength, agility, and stamina. She is extensively trained to near perfection in a variety of fighting styles, such as karate, judo, kung fu, and wrestling, and with all manner of weapons�both traditional and high-tech�combined with her background in gymnastics, acrobatics, and ballet to always accomplish her mission.

She can use a simple handgun just as well as a Chitauri battle staff or even Captain America's shield. Her signature weapons include dual batons, a pair of Glock 26s and the Black Widow�s Bite�bracelets that discharge electricity. Romanoff also displays great skill when it comes to hacking in computers and technological systems to dig for information or regaining control."
"Many of the Black Widow's enemies were assigned to her, first by the KGB and then by S.H.I.E.L.D.

In more recent years, though, she assists in taking down Ivan Vanko, Justin Hammer, the Chitauri, HYDRA, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, and Helmut Zemo among others. And those are just the targets we know about.

Some notable foes include, the Asgardian god of mischief, Loki and Ultron. She proves a formidable opponent to Loki, who assumes that he is able to manipulate her when he recalls her past misdeeds. Instead, it is Natasha who gets the upper hand on him, determining that he plans to release the Hulk as part of his plan. When Ultron captures her, she still undermines him to give the Avengers her location, helping them in their plan to defeat him.Following the events of the Sokovia Accords and Civil War, Romanoff is later forced to come out of hiding with Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson when Thanos and his followers come to Earth in a quest to gain all six Infinity Stones, which would could instantaneously eliminate half of all life in the Universe with a snap of a finger."
"Although she was raised to be autonomous and without attachments, the Black Widow has proven herself an exceptional team player.

Fellow agent and Avenger Clint Barton seems to be Natasha Romanoff's best friend. She feels she owes him a debt for the role he played in bringing her over from the KGB, instead of eliminating her as a target. She seems to care for him quite deeply, as she bargains for his release when Loki has him under his control. Also, at first, she is the only Avenger to know the existence of Hawkeye�s family.The Black Widow is loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. and Nick Fury before they both realize HYDRA manipulated them. Fury brings Romanoff and Barton in when he activates the Avengers Protocol, putting them side by side with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Thor. She goes on to fight alongside with Scarlet Witch, Vision, Falcon, War Machine, Winter Soldier, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and the Dora Milaje."
"According to Arnim Zola, Natasha Romanoff was born in 1984. Sometime shortly after that, she was indoctrinated by the Red Room, a Russian training program that took young girls and turned them into lethal undercover agents. In this era, Romanoff met Bucky Barnes during his time as the Winter Soldier, though the exact nature of their relationship has not yet been fully disclosed.

Romanoff proved an incredible asset for the KGB and succeeded in many of her missions. By her own admission, she didn't care who she took out or why. Several years back, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent agent Clint Barton to kill the Widow, but he made a different call and helped bring her in as S.H.I.E.L.D. asset.

The Black Widow got her first taste of the Super Hero life when Director Nick Fury assigned her to pose as Natalie Rushman and keep an eye on Tony Stark, who had already told the world he was Iron Man. As his new assistant at Stark Industries, Romanoff traveled with Stark to Monaco where he first faced off against Ivan Vanko. Shortly after revealing herself as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, she injected Stark with lithium dioxide to help him deal with the palladium poisoning from the arc reactor in his chest."
"Following the events of Justin Hammer and Ivan Vanko�s assault at the Stark Expo Presentation, Romanoff assessed Iron Man as an important asset, but noted that Stark suffered from compulsive behavior, self-destructive tendencies, and narcissism, making him unfit for the Avengers program by S.H.I.E.L.D.�s standards.

Two years later, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson sent her on an undercover mission in India, after Agent Barton had been compromised, to recruit Bruce Banner AKA the Hulk to aid in locating the Tesseract that had been stolen by Loki. Assembling as the Avengers, Romanoff along with Banner, Stark, Steve Rogers, Loki�s brother Thor, and Barton, free from his hypnotic state, were forced to battle Loki. The Asgardian prince used the Tesseract to open a portal unleashing his army of alien invaders, the Chitauri, in the streets of New York. Successfully closing the rift and neutralizing the threat, Romanoff returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. with Barton.

A few years following the Battle of New York, Romanoff and Captain America were assigned a mission to retake the Lemurian Star from pirates led by Georges Batroc. Widow had a secret side assignment from Director Fury to retrieve confidential S.H.I.E.L.D. files in a flash drive. In possession of the drive, Fury became the target of an assassin, the Winter Soldier. Hacking the protected files, Romanoff and Rogers went to Camp Leigh where the consciousness of Arnim Zola revealed HYDRA had not only survived World War II, but has manipulated S.H.I.E.L.D. from the beginning, with the Winter Soldier. Despite feeling duped for essentially trading KGB overlords for secret HYDRA ones, Widow worked with Captain America, the newly-recruited Falcon (Sam Wilson), and a wounded, but alive, Director Fury to put a plan in place to prevent HYDRA�s plan. They needed to not only stop this plan�Project Insight, meant to massacre millions deemed a threat to HYDRA�s new world order�from being initiated, and but also stop the Winter Soldier, who was revealed to be Steve Roger�s brainwashed best friend, Bucky Barnes."
"After releasing the secrets of both S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA, as well as her own dark history, Romanoff appeared before the Senate defending the dismantling of S.H.I.E.L.D. With all her covers blown, she gave Rogers a dossier on the Winter Soldier and then left to find a new identity.

Black Widow reassembled with the Avengers a year later in Sokovia, as the team raided Baron Wolfgang von Strucker�s HYDRA base to reclaim Loki�s scepter. Under the influence of Wanda Maximoff�s Scarlet Witch telekinetic powers, Romanoff was forced to relive her nightmarish past with the KGB and the Red Room�s Graduation Ceremony that sterilized her.

With Avengers Tower compromised by Ultron, the Avengers went off-the-grid to Barton�s homestead. Romanoff�s romantic overtures were rebuffed by Banner who believed there was no future with him knowing how dangerous his alter-ego is. Opening up about her past, Romanoff revealed how she sees herself as a monster as well.

Captured by Ultron in a Sokovian HYDRA base, Banner was sent to free Widow where she declared her love for him. Reuniting with the Avengers, the heroes fought Ultron�s drones and helped the Sokovians to safety. Following the battle, Romanoff tried making contact with Banner, but Hulk canceled the call, going into stealth mode and disappearing for two years."
"In the wake of the Ultron battle and the recruitment of new Avengers Scarlet Witch, Vision, War Machine and Falcon, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross enacted the Sokovia Accords, an agreement the Avengers were expected to sign that would make them part of the United Nations, an act Captain America strongly opposed. Despite her nature of operating in the shadows and her friendship to Rogers, Romanoff believed the better play with staying together and joined Stark�s team in support of governmental oversight.

At the climax of the Civil War, Romanoff revealed she had been on Rogers� side, even holding off the Black Panther in order for Rogers and Barnes to deal with Helmut Zemo. Betrayed, Stark halfheartedly warned her that Ross and the government will be coming for her. Romanoff left the Avengers Headquarters a fugitive."
"On the run and operating underground, Captain America, Falcon, and Black Widow were forced out of the shadows after stepping in to help Scarlet Witch and Vision fend off Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive in Scotland, and the larger Thanos threat as he pursued all six Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all life in the Universe.

Heading to the Avengers Compound in upstate New York, Widow, Cap, Falcon, Vision, and Scarlet Witch reunited with James Rhodes, who ignored Secretary of State Ross� demands to arrest the fugitives, and Bruce Banner, who had been missing after spending several years in space.

In an attempt to separate Vision from the Mind Stone so they could destroy it and keep it out of Thanos� hands, the group traveled to Wakanda. Joined by Wakanda�s tribes and Dora Milaje, Black Widow and the Avengers presented a front to Thanos� alien hordes."
"Wakanda, overwhelmed by the alien Outriders, received a much-needed boost from the arrival of Thor, his newly acquired Stormbreaker, and Guardians of the Galaxy Rocket and Groot. During the battle, Black Widow, Okoye, and Scarlet Witch worked together to take Proxima Midnight off the board.

When Thanos ultimately arrived on Earth, Widow unsuccessfully tried to stop the Mad Titan from obtaining Vision�s Mind Stone as he subdued her with Earthen tendrils. With all six Infinity Stones now in his possession, Thanos snapped half of all life in the Universe from existence. In Wakanda, Black Widow, along with Okoye, M�Baku, Rocket, Thor, Captain America, War Machine, and Hulk, survived the genocide and watched helplessly as many of their friends and allies disintegrated."
"Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the effects of gamma radiation on humans, working alongside Dr. Betty Ross at a Virginia University lab. Dr. Ross� father, General �Thunderbolt� Ross of the U.S. Army, channeled Banner�s work into a program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both doctors. When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he triggered a fantastic transformation in himself that resulted in an immense, hulking figure fueled by his own rage.

Having destroyed his lab as the creature, and inadvertently harming Ross in the process, Banner slipped away to avoid capture and study by the Army and began a desperate quest for a cure to his bizarre affliction."
"As intelligent and cerebral as Bruce Banner is, his alter-ego the Hulk is a completely physical phenomenon. The green behemoth possesses the greatest raw strength of any natural being on Earth, with an upper limit that has yet to be fully tested. His leg muscles allow him to leap great distances and land without harm, and his skin can resist damage from heavy weaponry, as well as the natural elements and even unnatural ones.

The Hulk has grown somewhat more intelligent over the years, beginning with the mind of nearly an infant and progressing to what might be described as the personality of a toddler. His speech has increased from growls and roars, to one or two words at a time, to full sentences, albeit broken and na�ve. Banner recognizes the Hulk as himself, but often refers to him as �the other guy,� while his alter-ego seems to have little love or respect for the mild scientist and may not even be cognizant that Banner is himself.The doctor transforms into the Hulk during moments of stress, anxiety, and most of all anger. The change can reverse itself if the Hulk reaches a state of calm, either by himself or through a special mantra utilized by his fellow Avengers, most notably Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow."
"Since his battle with the Abomination on the streets of Harlem, New York, the Hulk has tested his mettle against a crop of powerful opponents while as an Avenger and on his own. These include the alien Chitauri forces and their flying leviathans, the Asgardian trickster Loki, the high-tech soldiers of Hydra, Iron Man�s powerful �Hulkbuster� armor, the robotic despot Ultron, and Thor himself in the Sakaarian arenas of the Grandmaster.

While no physical match for the green giant, one might view General �Thunderbolt� Ross as the Hulk�s strongest and most persistent foe, in the sense of the man�s dogged pursuit of Banner and his alter-ego and his casual willingness to subvert the doctor�s life�s work into weaponry for the U. S. military. In terms of sheer power, the tyrant Thanos has given the Hulk a run for his money and bested him in direct combat.

While the Hulk has faced strong foes before, none so definitively beat him in combat as Thanos, who was able to quickly subdue the jade giant when they fought. Hulk�s subsequent refusal to physical manifest himself may be due to that encounter, even as Bruce Banner continues the fight against Thanos and his followers."
"While at the university at which he did his initial gamma research, Bruce Banner was romantically involved with his partner, Dr. Betty Ross. After becoming the Hulk, he seemed to maintain his memory and knowledge of the relationship and gravitated toward Betty to protect her from harm. After the Hulk�s first real battle with another creature nearly as strong as himself, he was prevented from killing his foe by Betty and fled the area without her, which seems to have been the last time they were in contact.

After allying himself with the Avengers, Banner entered into a complex romantic relationship with Natasha Romanoff, the master spy called the Black Widow. At first, Banner resisted his feelings for Romanoff, citing his inability to live a normal life as a reason to maintain a platonic partnership with her. The Black Widow convinced him otherwise and for a brief moment it seemed the two might find happiness together, before the Hulk decided to leave, likely reflecting Banner�s own concerns.

Both Banner and the Hulk have witnessed a friendship flourish with the Asgardian Thor, a fellow Avenger. At first, the two struggled through violent clashes and petty arguments over who was the strongest, but these contests led to camaraderie during their time as enslaved gladiators on the planet Sakaar. In Thor, the Hulk may have finally found his truest companion.Tony Stark has also reached out to Bruce Banner as a peer in the realm of science, and as a man who suffers from a debilitation much like he himself once did. Together, the two have worked together on projects seemingly as one mind, though Banner has raised objections to what he feels are moral and ethical gaps in Stark�s push to advance technology."
"Bruce Banner spent five years hiding from Ross and the army, until finally settling in Brazil to focus his search for a cure in plant research and mind-relaxing techniques. During this time, he communicated with cellular biologist Doctor Samuel Sterns back in the U.S., but the unintended transportation of Banner�s irradiated blood to a man in Milwaukee exposed his whereabouts to �Thunderbolt� Ross and his operative, Emil Blonsky. Banner reentered the country to try and recover his original research data from Culver University, but that meant the Hulk came with him and not even a reunion with Betty Ross could quell the angered beast.

After making his way first to Smoky Mountains National Forest and then the steel canyons of New York, Bruce Banner was forced to pit his alter-ego against a gamma-transformed Blonsky, the duplicity of Dr. Sterns, and the ever-looming �Thunderbolt� Ross. The Hulk defeated Blonsky and moved in for the kill, but Betty Ross stopped him from crossing this line and he fled once again. Soon after, in seclusion, Banner began to try and gain more control over the Hulk.

Sometime later, S.H.I.E.L.D.�s Nick Fury dispatched his operative Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, to approach Banner in India and convince him to join the so-called Avengers Initiative. Unfortunately, the team�s first mission, to prevent Loki�s despoiling of the planet with the mystical Tesseract device, brought the Hulk and his other potential teammates into the trickster�s crosshairs, resulting in a furious battle onboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier between Hulk and Thor. During that fight, the Hulk crashed down to Earth and transformed back into Banner, and then made his way back to New York. Explaining to his fellow Avengers that he was in fact always, on some level, angry, he was able to consciously transform into the Hulk to assist the Avengers in their fight against aliens brought to Earth by Loki�s machinations, and the would-be conquerors were ultimately defeated."
"Following the Avengers� first victory, Banner spent time with Tony Stark for scientific pursuits and even acted as a sounding board for Stark to share his troubles with, after the billionaire suffered through post-traumatic stress disorder. With somewhat more say in the Hulk�s appearances, Banner joined the Avengers on missions to root out the terrorist organization Hydra around the globe, though he remained wary of his changes into the beast. The Avengers found that a certain lullaby, typically said by the Black Widow, was able to calm the Hulk and help him revert back to Banner, when the Hulk�s strength was no longer needed. During this time, Banner developed feelings for Natasha Romanoff, though he was also hesitant about beginning a romantic relationship, fearful of its potential pitfalls, given his situation."

During this time, Banner developed feelings for Natasha Romanoff, though he was also hesitant about beginning a romantic relationship, fearful of its potential pitfalls, given his situation."
"Subsequently, a wormhole brought the Quinjet containing the Hulk to the far-off planet Sakaar. There he found what seemed a fitting place for a being such as himself�as a fighter in the Grandmaster�s gladiator arena. Besting all others in battle, he soon became the Grandmaster�s beloved champion and remained the Hulk at all times, never changing back into Bruce Banner. When his fellow Avenger Thor arrived on the planet and was forced into the arena as well, the Hulk was pitted against him. The fight that ensued ended somewhat indecisively for the satisfaction of either. In the aftermath of their fight, the Hulk, while bonding more with Thor, initially didn�t want to help his fellow Avenger in his plan to escape. When the Hulk attempted to stop Thor from using the Avengers Quinjet to leave Sakaar, a recording of Romanoff onboard made the creature transform back into Banner for the first time in two years.

The Hulk had damaged the Quinjet beyond repair. So, Thor, aided by Loki, found another ship to leave Sakaar and return to his native Asgard to reclaim the throne from his older sister Hela, with Banner and the warrior Valkyrie accompanying him. Overcoming his concerns that transforming back into the Hulk could result in never returning to his human form, Banner chose to allow his alter-ego to resurface after Hela unleashed her giant wolf, Fenris, against the surviving Asgardians. As the Hulk, he defeated the huge animal. In the meantime, Thor put an end to Hela, albeit at the cost of Asgard itself. Upon Asgard�s destruction, the Hulk�still having not changed back into Banner�joined the remaining Asgardians on a space ship launched into the cosmos to find a new home. He was present as Thor accepted his new role as the leader of his people."
"The ship was discovered by the space tyrant Thanos soon after and he decimated the Asgardians to find the Infinity Stone Loki harbored. The Hulk attacked Thanos, but was bested by him in combat and then transported back to Earth by Heimdall�s last action.

Crashing into Doctor Strange�s Sanctum in New York City, the Hulk changed back to Bruce Banner, who informed Strange, Wong, and Tony Stark of the tyrant�s intention to come to Earth to claim the Infinity Stones that were on the planet. When two of Thanos� followers arrived to try and take the Infinity Stone in the possession of Doctor Strange, Banner found himself now unable to transform back into the Hulk at all�with the Hulk outright resisting any attempt to get him to manifest."
"When Iron Man was taken off planet, Banner called in Steve Rogers for help, and in doing so was reunited with Natasha Romanoff, along with several of his Avengers teammates. Banner then traveled with Cap and his crew to Wakanda to protect the Infinity Stone that gave the android Vision artificial life. There, he conferred with the brilliant inventor Shuri on how to remove the Stone and destroy it without harming Vision. To give Shuri time to perform the operation, Banner donned Stark�s �Hulkbuster� armor to fight alongside the Black Panther and his Wakandan army, along with his fellow Avengers, against an army of Thanos� followers. However, when Thanos himself arrived and successfully claimed the last of the six Stones, the battle was lost. Half of all life in the universe disintegrated when the tyrant willed it to happen, leaving Banner and only a few remaining Avengers and allies to try to make sense of the tragedy."
"Very little is known about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Hawkeye or his origins. An accomplished combatant and weapons master, he was present for Thor�s arrival on Earth, and was impressed with the God of Thunder. He was also instrumental in bringing over Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, to the side of S.H.I.E.L.D, sparing her life and offering her a path to redemption.

For his extraordinary abilities, he was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of the Avengers Initiative. Unfortunately, in his first mission with the Avengers, he initially worked against them, thanks his mind being controlled by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief. After being broken free, however, the horrified Clint did work alongside his fellow Super Heroes to bring down the trickster god.

Since then, he has managed to put his talents to good use against the Chitauri, Ultron, HYDRA, and even his fellow Avengers when it seemed necessary."
"As one of S.H.I.E.L.D.�s best agents, the World�s greatest marksman, and an Avenger, Hawkeye uses traditional weapons as well as high-tech ones, with a strong affinity for his archery bows. Few humans on the planet compare to Clint Barton when it comes to his astonishing talents in precise marksmanship, fighting, flying, and tactical prowess.

An expert acrobat, military-trained combatant, and master assassin, Barton can stand toe-to-toe with some of the best fighters around. He is also a master tactician and spy�the Avengers face quite a bit of difficulty when Hawkeye works for Loki and turns his plans against them.

Hawkeye�s specialized equipment include recurve bows, compound bows, a specialized arrow quiver, speed loader, Busse dagger, a S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued handgun, and collapsible baton"
"Plenty of people wind up on the wrong end of Barton�s arrows, especially based on the direct orders of S.H.I.E.L.D.

As he is part of the Avengers Initiative, his enemies are the ones that threaten this group and Earth. He faces the likes of the Chitauri, HYDRA, Ultron and his robotic sentries, Ulysses Klaue, in his bid to keep the world safe. Hawkeye even battles his fellow heroes when they stand in the way of Captain America and the Winter Soldier getting to Siberia, when the Avengers split over the Sokovia Accords.

His most notable enemy, however, is Loki. With his strong sense of morality, Clint suffers at the thought of having worked against S.H.I.E.L.D. and his fellow agents, mourning the losses at his hand. He blames Loki for this violation, and the Asgardian prince has earned Barton�s eternal enmity."
"As an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Clint Barton is allied with many in this organization. He respects and takes orders from Nick Fury (unless they contradict his own sense of what is right) and supports colleagues like Maria Hill and Phil Coulson.

His closest friendship is with Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, who he recruits for S.H.I.E.L.D. They often work together on missions and have a strong rapport. Natasha has been known to wear an arrow necklace in honor of her friend, and even bargains for his release when he is under Loki�s control. He cannot bring himself to fight her properly when they are on opposing sides of the Sokovia Accord dispute. She is also the only agent apart from Nick Fury that he entrusts with knowledge of his family (until he brings the Avengers to his compound). When Director Fury put the Avengers initiative in place, Barton fights alongside the likes of Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and eventually, Ant-Man, Vision, Falcon, War Machine and other heroes. He forms a close bond with the Maximoff twins, acting as a mentor when they switch sides to face against Ultron. He mentors Scarlet Witch, encouraging her to face her fears and become and Avenger. Pietro Maximoff, AKA Quicksilver, even gives his life to save Hawkeye.

Most important to him, however, are his wife Laura and kids Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel (whose middle name �Pietro� reflects the hero�s sacrifice)."
"S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clint Barton has kept his past and private life a secret, like any good spy. Known only to his closest confidantes, he is married to Laura Barton and together, the couple have three children, Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel. When not globe-trotting on missions, he lives with his family on the homestead that Director Nick Fury helped establish for them in secret.

Dubbed Hawkeye, Barton has used his beyond expert-level marksman skills to remove S.H.I.E.L.D.�s enemies from the board; however, he has been known to make his own moral judgment calls in the field. In one case, Fury sent Barton to kill the Russian assassin codenamed Black Widow. Instead, he offered to bring Natasha Romanoff over to their side and the two not only became not only faithful allies, but also good friends."
"Barton had his first encounter with the growing super community while tasked with guarding the site near Puente Antiguo, New Mexico where an enchanted and powerful alien war-hammer landed. After Agent Phil Coulson reported its existence to Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. put up a facility around it. When the Asgardian god of thunder Thor showed up one night to regain his erstwhile companion, Coulson ordered Barton to be their eyes up high. When Thor failed to lift the weapon, Barton stood down.

Hawkeye had another run-in with another Asgardian a year later at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, while guarding the Tesseract and the experiments surrounding the weapon, led by Dr. Erik Selvig. When the Tesseract suddenly opened a portal, like Hawkeye had predicted, Thor�s brother Loki emerged. He attacked the base and controlled the minds of Dr. Selvig and Barton with his scepter.

Under Loki�s control, Barton stole the Tesseract and helped Loki and Selvig escape, nearly killing Director Fury and Agent Hill in the process. As Loki�s acting commander, Barton traveled to Stuttgart, Germany, with Loki to secure a supply of iridium to stabilize the Tesseract."
"Testing the Avengers Initiative, Barton led a group of mercenaries to attack Fury�s team, while Loki allowed himself to be captured as part of his plan to unleash the Hulk and use the Tesseract to bring about war on Earth. Romanoff was able to get the drop on Barton; knocking her friend unconscious and so breaking Loki�s hold on him, restoring his mind. Guilt-ridden for the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents he harmed, Barton joined Captain America and Widow on their mission to prevent Loki from using Selvig�s Tesseract device in New York City.

Piloting the Quinjet, Hawkeye and the other heroes saw the Tesseract used to open a portal above the city, allowing alien Chitauri soldiers through the sky. Assembling alongside Captain America, Black Widow, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk, Hawkeye fought the oncoming Chitauri warriors with his military combat skills and weaponized arrows. Closing the portal, the Avengers were able to stop the alien invasion on New York City and detain Loki. With Thor returning Loki and the Tessearct to Asgard, the team went their separate ways.

Three years later, with the threat of HYDRA on the rise, the Avengers were called upon to assemble once more to retrieve Loki�s Scepter from Baron Wolfgang von Strucker�s HYDRA base in Sokovia. Unable to contend with an enhanced Pietro Maximoff�s distracting speed, Hawkeye was blasted by a HYDRA agent. With the mission a success, Hawkeye and the group returned to Avengers Tower where Dr. Helen Cho used her Regeneration Cradle to patch him up."
"At the Avengers Tower, the sentient Ultron, in a malfunctioning Iron Legion drone, introduced himself as a creation of Tony Stark to bring about peace. Before dispatching an army of Ultron Sentries, Ultron revealed his plans of peace by way of the extinction of the Avengers, which he saw a danger to the world.

Traveling to the coast of Johannesburg, the divisive Avengers discovered Ultron had murdered von Strucker and intended to secure the Wakandan metal Vibranium from Ulysses Klaue. While Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America faced Ultron head-on, Hawkeye and Black Widow confronted Ultron�s agents from Sokovia: the enhanced man, Quicksilver, and his twin sister Wanda Maximoff, Scarlet Witch, who displayed telekinetic and telepathic abilities. Barton discovered Scarlet Witch mind-punched the team with terrible visions, inducing Hulk into a rage. He was able to avoid this fate, however, and disabled Scarlet Witch.

Following the destruction, and backlash, of the battle between Iron Man and the rampaging Hulk in the South African town, and the team recovering from Scarlet Witch�s visions, Hawkeye flew the Avengers to a safehouse�his secret homestead�where they met Barton�s pregnant wife and children. In private, Laura expressed her concern for her husband if he remained in the Avengers, not because he was inferior nor enhanced like the others, but that the team was a mess and would not support him, to which Barton retorted they were his mess.

With new intel from Fury, the Avengers prepared their next move, which Barton promised his wife would be his final mission with the team. Heading to Seoul, they discovered Ultron and the Maximoff twins planned for Dr. Cho to build Ultron a new body made of Vibranium and the Mind Stone, which was housed in Loki�s Scepter, using the Cradle. Before Ultron�s consciousness was transferred into the body, Hawkeye managed to intercept the Cradle and secure the vessel at Avengers Tower, though he was distraught that Romanoff had been captured by the Super Villain in the process."
"While Stark and Banner secretly worked to bring the Cradle creation to life, Barton focused on locating Romanoff. Captain America and the recently defected Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver reacted negatively to Stark and Banner�s plan to upload JARVIS to the Cradle body. The arguments ceased when Thor arrived and used his lightning to activate the machine. The newly created being�who called itself Vision�shocked the team when he lifted Thor�s Mjolnir as proof of his honor and desire to stop Ultron.

With no time to lose, the Avengers flew to Sokovia to evacuate the civilians, rescue Black Widow, and stop Ultron once and for all. As Ultron unleashed an army of sentries, before using a device to send the entire city floating off ground, Hawkeye and the Avengers engaged Ultron�s army while protecting the city. Amidst the battle, Hawkeye saved Wanda who was suffering from a panic attack, while giving her the option to stay inside and safe, or to exit the building to fight, as an Avenger. Emboldened, Scarlet Witch emerged and helped Hawkeye clear their area before the entire team converged on the old church to protect the core."
"With Ultron on the defensive, the team succeeded in holding off wave after wave of sentries and protecting the device�s key. As Hawkeye and Widow were ushering civilians onto S.H.I.E.L.D. lifeboats nearby, Ultron unleashed a barrage of bullets at Hawkeye from his own Quinjet. Shielding a young child and discovering no bullets had struck them, Barton turned to see a fatally-wounded Pietro, who had taken every one of the bullets for him.

Following the events of Sokovia and destroying Ultron, Barton returned home as promised and retired from the Avengers. The Bartons named their newborn son Nathaniel Pietro Barton after Quicksilver and Romanoff.

He was out of the game when Captain America lead a mission to Lagos, resulting in Scarlet Witch accidentally killing civilians in a nearby building. When asked how he felt about the Sokovia Accords, which put the Avengers under the oversight of the United Nations, Black Widow replied that Barton was retired. However, heroes like Hawkeye always seem to show up when needed.

Captain America called upon Barton when he was in need of help�against Iron Man and his team who supported the Sokovia Accords. Traveling to the New Avengers Facility, Barton tried to retrieve Scarlet Witch who was kept there by Vision, at the request of Tony Stark. The two then went on to recruit Scott Lang, AKA Ant-Man, and met up with Rogers, Wilson and Barnes in Berlin. Eager to repay the debt he owed Maximoff, Barton agreed to aid Rogers in his mission to stop the Winter Soldiers, HYDRA�s elite group of assassins, under the control of Helmut Zemo"
"Making their way to Flughafen Leipzig-Halle Airport, intending to depart to Siberia, Captain America and his team were surrounded by Iron Man�s team. Hawkeye stood alongside Captain America prepared to fight their former teammates and friends. With the odds against the entire team making the trip to Siberia, they devised a plan for Captain America and the Winter Soldier to make it to Siberia. Following the clash at the airport, Barton, Maximoff, Lang, and Wilson were captured and imprisoned at the Raft, an underwater prison.

Captain America infiltrated the Raft and freed his allies, including Hawkeye. Barton and Lang signed the Accords and made a deal with the government to return home under house arrest instead of returning to the Raft.

Clint Barton�s whereabouts and status following Thanos� elimination of half of the Universe�s population is unknown at this time."
"Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Loki�s people, and Odin�hoping to teach his son humility�divested Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.

Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town. While his brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant king�his real father�into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep. Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to full Asgardian power. With Mjolnir once again in his grasp and the admiration and possible love of Jane Foster, Thor returned to his home, routed the Frost Giants, and defeated Loki in battle. Chagrined at his loss and stinging from Odin�s condemnation, Loki chose to fall away from Asgard into a strange warp in space while Thor and their father looked on. Though happy to be back in Asgard, Thor�s thoughts were filled with adventure on Midgard with Jane Foster."
"Like all Asgardians, Thor possesses great strength, endurance, stamina, and long life, but it is his command over the stormy forces of nature that separate him from his brethren as a true son of Odin the Allfather. Thor can call down lightning and thunder at will and utilize them like a blacksmith uses his tools to work iron and steel�bending and shaping them into weapons. Once he believed it was his hammer Mjolnir that granted him these powers, but in truth the ability has rested within him the whole time. For nearly a thousand years Thor holds Mjolnir�s grip in battle, a true companion if ever there was one. The incredible hammer was forged by Odin from the heart of a dying star and gifted to his son for his exclusive use. Odin even places an enchantment on it when he banishes Thor to Midgard, one that would only allow a �worthy� person to lift it and possess the power of the god of thunder. While Thor is with the Avengers on Earth, his comrades all try to handle the hammer, but only Captain America could move it slightly, a feat that its owner takes notice of.

After Mjolnir�s destruction by Hela, Thor forges a new weapon when the threat of Thanos arises. With the help of Eitri, a Dwarven smithy of Nidavellir, and an adolescent Groot, Thor crafts Stormbreaker, an immense axe with some of the same properties as his hammer, along with the ability to open the Bifrost."
"Thor develops a number of adversaries in his quest to protect Asgard, and also Midgard, from harm.

The relationship between Thor and Loki may rightfully be categorized as �complicated.� Raised as brothers, the two men know each other better than anyone, yet have been continually at odds, sometimes to notably extreme degrees. Loki�s scheming nature and unbridled egoism comes between him and Thor many times over, causing trouble that has literally impacted entire worlds. Still Thor, overcoming multiple betrayals, believes the man he calls brother can change and embrace the light. And it seems Thor�s belief in his is redeemed when Loki gives his life to protect Thor from Thanos�leaving Thor to deeply mourn his brother�s loss.

Among Thor�s more clear-cut enemies stand Frost Giant King Laufey, Surtur the Fire Giant, the dark elf Malekith, and Thor�s own half-sister Hela, the so-called goddess of death, all of whom have ill intent towards Asgard. Thor also finds himself imprisoned for a time on Sakaar by the Grandmaster.

Thanos earns Thor�s immense hatred after the tyrant�s crusade wipes out many Asgardians and kills loved ones of the god of thunder, making things very personal for him."
"Thor grows up surrounded by warriors and fighters, and it is among that august group that he can count the majority of his close companions.

Heimdall, all-seeing keeper of the Bifrost Bridge, offers Thor advice and counsel whenever he requests it, and many times when he does not. Thor treasures his friendship with Heimdall, and they often fight back to back against those who threaten their home. Likewise, both Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) are valued comrades of Thor, battling at his side over the years. They take pride in the fact that they always had each other�s backs in a fight, until the Warriors Three perish during Hela�s siege on Asgard."
"On Earth, Jane Foster is a warrior in her own right, a woman who stands up for what she believes in and never backs down no matter how big a challenge she faces. These traits impress Thor from the moment he meets the young scientist, and their admiration for each other quickly grows into love. Whenever Thor is away from Earth, he counts the minutes until he returns to Jane Foster�s side. Unfortunately, the two part ways eventually. The Asgardian also feels a bond with Dr. Erik Selvig, Foster�s partner, and he looks to the scientist many times for insight not only into deep matters, but also for his knowledge of the world.

Of all of Thor�s Avengers teammates, Steve Rogers, Captain America, is perhaps the one that he trusts most with his life, though he will always remain a faithful companion to the others, including Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. The latter, in fact, more recently becomes a closer friend to Thor, as Banner�s alter ego the Hulk battles Thor in the gladiatorial arena on Sakaar and fights beside him in Asgard.

Thor also makes the acquaintance of one of the fabled Valkyrie on Sakaar, a warrior woman self-exiled from Asgard and her duties as one of its protectors. Though she at first opposes everything Thor stands for, she comes around to his desire to return to Asgard and vanquish its conqueror, Hela. In doing so, she becomes yet another staunch ally of the thunder god�s, as does the Kronan named Korg, who also fights with Thor on both Sakaar and Asgard. While Thor encounters all of the Guardians of the Galaxy, he forges a special bond with Rocket, who accompanies him on his journey to create Stormbreaker in order to battle Thanos. Groot, who also joined that mission, becomes an ally as well."
"When Loki made his way to Earth to capture the fabled Tesseract�one of the infamous Infinity Stones�for his own plans and schemes, Thor asked Odin to use dark magic to send him to the planet also, so that he could confront his brother. While there, Thor came across a small group of loose-knit Earth heroes attempting to stop Loki, so he took command of his brother himself. In doing so, he brought about a battle with Iron Man and Captain America. When the dust cleared and Loki had escaped, Thor agreed to work alongside the Avengers to bring his brother to justice.

Finally seizing Loki, the Avengers brought him into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but unfortunately also into close proximity to Bruce Banner, whose alter-ego the Hulk turned out to be one of Loki�s true targets. Thor was forced to battle an enraged Hulk until the Avengers could sort out the situation and come together as a real team to defeat Thor�s wayward brother. Thor joined alongside the Avengers in New York and ultimately defeated Loki and the Chitauri army he led. With Loki bound as his prisoner, Thor bid farewell to his new Midgard companions and returned home with the Tesseract."
"Back in Asgard, Odin charged his son with traveling through the Nine Realms and addressing hot spots of vandals, marauders, and other troublemakers. Unbeknownst to him at the time, Jane Foster came in contact with the Aether, another of the Infinity Stones, and unwittingly bonded with it. Discovering the event, Thor brought Foster to Asgard for examination and safekeeping, but when the Dark Elves invaded Asgard to take back the Aether, Thor�s mother Frigga died while valiantly defending her husband and her home.

After a series of clashes with Malekith, the Dark Elves� ruler, both on the Elves� home world of Svartalfheim and Earth, Thor managed to defeat his foe in the midst of a mixture of assistance, interference and subterfuge from Loki �who then feigned his own death�and wrested the Aether from him. Later, he approached Odin to tell his father he had no real desire to rule Asgard, not knowing that his brother had secretly replaced their father and was posing as him.

Returning to Earth sometime later, Thor rejoined the Avengers to hunt the global terrorist organization called Hydra in various spots around the globe. In the small nation of Sokovia, he and his partners recovered Loki�s powerful scepter from a Hydra base, but Tony Stark later used it to create an artificial intelligence dubbed Ultron, much to Thor�s chagrin. While they began to deal with the malicious robot, Thor came under the spell of the Scarlet Witch, a young Sokovian with incredible mind-warping powers, and received a hellish vision."
"With his friend Dr. Erik Selvig, Thor traveled to the magical Water of Sight to look further into the troubling vision and learn more about the Infinity Stones. Back with his teammates, he brought lightning down to aid in the creation of another artificial being�this one a true ally, whom the Avengers dubbed the Vision. Together, they battled and defeated Ultron, but watched helplessly as the entire Sokovian capital was destroyed in the process.

Thor felt his next labor should be a comprehensive search throughout the Nine Realms to gather up the Infinity Stones. While on this quest he encountered and was captured by the Fire Giant Surtur, the being who was fabled to bring about Ragnarok, the ultimate destruction of Asgard. Thor defeated Surtur, and believing he�d stopped the advance of Ragnarok, flew back to his home to relay the news to his father. There, he found only Loki disguised as Odin. Angered, he broke the illusion and took his brother with him to Earth to begin tracking Odin�s whereabouts."
"With help from the sorcerer Doctor Strange, the two brothers found their father living simply in Norway, but also near death. Upon his peaceful demise, his first child Hela, mistress of death, was able to leave the prison Odin placed her in millennia before and return to conquer the Asgardians. Thor opposed her instantly, but Hela shattered Mjolnir and left to invade Asgard.

Falling through space after his encounter with Hela, Thor crashed down upon the planet of Sakaar, where the infamous being called the Grandmaster ran a gladiatorial arena. Seemingly without his unique powers from his hammer, Thor became a fighter and found himself face to face with the champion of the realm, his old Avengers comrade the Hulk. Together with the green giant and Valkyrie, one of the fabled female warrior-protectors of Asgard, they flew off to Thor�s home to confront Hela with some help from Loki and the freed Sakaarian gladiators, too."
"During the ensuing battle, Thor lost an eye to Hela�s immense powers, but also learned that his command over thunder and lightning rested within him, not in lost Mjolnir. With resumed confidence in himself, he saw to Surtur�s rebirth and the advent of Ragnarok in order to destroy Hela�s threat once and for all. Though this meant the loss of Asgard as well, as Thor realized it was important to save the citizens of his land more than the land itself. Finally embracing his role as king of his people, Thor led the Asgardian survivors and the allies who fought with him onto a starship, intending to hear to Earth.

At some point in the ship�s travels, Thanos interrupted its voyage to decimate the Asgardians onboard and take the Tesseract from Loki. Thor witnessed the murder of both Heimdall and Loki and swore to kill Thanos, a proclamation the tyrant shrugged off as he destroyed the ship and teleported away. Later, the Guardians of the Galaxy found Thor floating in space and upon rescuing him, the thunder god declared his intention to forge a Thanos-killing weapon on Nidavellir, the same place Mjolnir was crafted.

Thor left on his journey accompanied by Groot and Rocket, and during their travels, Rocket gave him a cybernetic eye to replace the one Hela had cut out. The trio arrived at Nidavellir to find it cold and inoperable, but with the aid of the Dwarf smithy Eitri, Thor restarted the forge and created Stormbreaker, a gigantic axe.

"
"Using Stormbreaker�s ability to command the Bifrost to return to Earth, he arrived in Wakanda to join the fight against Thanos� forces, who were attempting to wrest an Infinity Stone from the android Vision�s head. Thor destroyed many of the alien troops, turning the tide of the battle, and was reunited with Captain America and other Avengers during the fight.

However, when Thanos himself arrived, he successfully got ahold of the Mind Stone and added it to his Infinity Gauntlet. Determined to kill his enemy, Thor buried Stormbreaker in the tyrant�s chest. Unfortunately, Thanos was still able to snap his fingers, and with the combined might of all six Infinity Stones, wipe away exactly half of all life in the universe. Thanos teleported away, and Thor and those who were spared watched many treasured allies disintegrate before them."
"Loki, Prince of Asgard, Odinson, rightful heir of Jotunheim, and God of Mischief, is burdened with glorious purpose. His desire to be a king drives him to sow chaos in Asgard. In his lust for power, he extends his reach to Earth where he believes they need a ruler and encounters unlikely heroes that interfere with his schemes."
"The ever-scheming Loki, raised as the son of King Odin and Queen Frigga of Asgard, is resentful of living in his brother Thor�s shadow. Loki studied magical arts earning the �God of Mischief� title, while his brother pursued physical prowess. Believing himself to be the rightful King of Asgard, Loki schemes to undermine the God of Thunder�s ascension to the throne, desperate for his father�s approval and to be seen as an equal to Thor.

During Thor�s banishment to the realm Midgard, Odin revealed Loki�s true parentage. Ages ago, Odin fought and defeated Laufey and the Frost Giants of Jotunheim in a great war. Abandoned and left for dead as a baby due to his diminutive size, Odin took Loki, son of Laufey, to Asgard to raise him as his son and a prince in order to one day unite the Frost Giants and the Asgards in peace.

Furious that he had been lied to all his life and used as Odin�s political pawn instead of loved as his son, Loki set on several paths to prove his worth of the throne and superiority over Thor."
"Loki possesses strength, durability, and longevity far superior to humans. The most powerful sorcerer in all of Asgard, Loki�s magical abilities include astral projection, shape-shifting, hypnosis, molecular rearrangement, energy blasts, levitating, conjuration, cryokinesis, telekinesis and teleportation. In addition, Loki can connect to others telepathically and see into their memories, mystically imbue objects, and create rifts between dimensions.

A master of manipulation and deceit, Loki is highly intelligent with immense knowledge and skill in wielding mystical artifacts, arcane lore, and human as well as alien technology. A highly-tactical thinker, Loki is able to manipulate opportunities and events in his favor; his cunning mind far exceeding Thor and Odin�s.

Loki, an expert combatant, typically wields throwing knives and other small blades. The God of Mischief has also wielded a Chitauri Scepter gifted by the Other and Thanos, Odin�s Gungnir spear, the Casket of the Ancient Winters, and the Tesseract."
"While Loki�s enemies are difficult to determine given Loki�s questionable allegiances, some notable foes do stand out.

The relationship between Loki and Thor and Odin could be labeled �complicated,� at best. Initially good and altruistic, Loki soon sees his adoptive father, King Odin, and his brother Thor as more thorns in his side, preventing him from becoming the ruler he is meant to be. Upon learning his true parentage, Loki feels anger and betrayal for Odin�s deception, believing the Allfather saw him as a monster never meant for the Asgardian throne. This fuels his unrelenting jealousy of Thor and feelings of inferiority.

Despite his latent love for his family and occasionally helping Thor when he feels inspired, he typically betrays him. Thor�s closest friends�Sif and the Warriors Three Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun�and Asgardian gatekeeper Heimdall support the God of Thunder in all things and are always wary of Loki�s misplaced loyalties. However, Thor continually believes in Loki�s ability to be more."
"When Loki steals an unknown entity that is thought to be an unlimited source of energy, the Tesseract, he finds himself facing off against S.H.I.E.L.D. This espionage and protection agency, led by Director Nick Fury and supported by agents Maria Hill and Phillip Coulson, assembles the Avengers to fight him.

The Avengers, a group of super-powered and remarkable people known as Earth�s defenders, which includes Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and later Falcon, Vision and Scarlet Witch, pose a threat to Loki�s schemes to take over and rule Earth.

His longlist of enemies that stand between him and his desires include Malekith and the Dark Elves, Odin�s first-born Hela, and Jane Foster. More recently, the Mad Titan Thanos and his followers�Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian�cross paths with Loki when he is fleeing along with other Asgardians from their demolished home world. It is then Loki faces off against a threat perhaps too big for him, but also reaffirms his brother�s repeated belief in him."
"Loki�s allies are similarly challenging to pinpoint, as his charm and powers of manipulation serve him to ally with anyone who suits his purposes.

However, Loki does deeply care for and loves his adoptive mother Frigga above anyone else in his family. She teaches him in the ways of astral projection and encourages his gift for sorcery. He feels deep remorse and pain for how his schemes play a role in her demise, and has a breakdown when she passes.

The Chitauri, an ancient race of extraterrestrials led by the Other, take Loki under their wing. They gift him ancient knowledge and a Chitauri scepter to wield. The Other serves Thanos. This former ally turns into an enemy once the Mad Titan threatens the lives of half of the Asgardian refugees, along with his brother Thor.

Clint Barton AKA Hawkeye and Dr. Erik Selvig are pawns in Loki's scheme to rule Earth. He controls them using a Chitauri Scepter, bending them to his will.

Laufey is the biological father of Loki. Despite being abandoned, Loki invites the King of the Frost Giants to Asgard to murder the sleeping Asgardian King Odin and start a second war between Jotunheim and Asgard. However, Laufey is ultimately betrayed and killed by Loki.

On Sakaar, Loki wins the favor of the Grandmaster, a hedonistic tyrant who manipulates life-forms into fighting each other in the Contest of Champions. Unwilling to be left behind on Sakaar, Loki ultimately aligns with Revengers Thor, Hulk, and Valkyrie to defeat Hela and save the remaining Asgardian populace from Ragnarok."
"Loki Laufeyson, son of the King of Jotunheim, was abandoned and left to die by Laufey, viewing the babe unusually small for a Frost Giant. Following a war between the Frost Giants and Asgardians, Odin, King of Asgard, found Loki and took him home to raise as his son and an Asgardian prince along with his biological son Thor. Queen Frigga raised him in the arts of sorcery, teaching him everything she knew.

Unaware of his true heritage and tired of living in Thor�s shadows, on the day of Thor�s coronation, Loki secretly opened pathways in the eternal realm allowing the Frost Giants to infiltrate Asgard and into Odin�s vault. When their attempts to retrieve the Casket of the Ancient Winters�the Frost Giant�s source of power�failed, Thor wanted to retaliate. Enraged and pushed by Loki to act rashly, Thor, disobeying Odin�s direct orders, sought out the Frost Giants on their land of Jotunheim alongside Loki, Sif and the Warriors Three Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun, to send a message that they cannot attack Asgard without consequence.

Taunted by a giant, Thor led his friends into battle. It was here Loki learned he was able to withstand a Frost Giant�s touch, experiencing no pain. Their presence on Jotunheim all but started a war with the Jotun until Odin intervened. Banished to the Migard realm known as Earth for his insolence, Odin stripped Thor of his powers and his hammer Mjolnir. Inspired by these events and distraught about surviving a Jotun�s touch and believe himself cursed, Loki sought out the Casket and demanded his true heritage from Odin."
"Unable to see past his anger, Loki believed his family viewed him as a monster, for Asgardians are raised to hate Jotuns, that he was rescued by Odin not out of compassion, but as a political tool of peace. That Odin never had any intention of putting a Frost Giant on the throne of Asgard. Distraught over his family falling apart and the impending war with Jotunheim, Loki chastised the Allfather into Odinsleep, a period when Odin sleeps to regain strength.

Offered the position of acting king by his mother, Loki briefly visits Thor to tell him their father has died and their mother refuses his return in fear of sparking war with the Frost Giants. He then invites Laufey into Asgard to kill Odin while he slept and take back the Casket. With Sif and the Warriors Three loyal to Thor and seeking to retrieve the rightful heir, Loki sent the Destroyer to Earth to eliminate Thor and his friends. After battling with the Destroyer, powered by Loki�s mind, Thor sacrifices himself to save the people of Earth, bending Loki to ease up on his brother.

Upon infiltrating Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey with Odin�s Gungnir, as a maneuver to attack Jotunheim using the Bifrost, which would ultimately destroy the planet, to prove himself worthy as Asgard�s king. Returning to Asgard and stopping the destruction of Jotunheim, Thor destroyed the Rainbow Bridge cutting off his and Asgard�s access to Earth and the other realms. Falling into the abyss, the newly-awoken Odin saved both his sons from the black hole. Devastated that the Allfather could not see his actions were for him and Asgard, Loki lets go and falls into the abyss."
"Arriving at the Sanctuary through a wormhole caused by the Bifrost, Loki met the Other, ruler of the ancient race of extraterrestrials the Chitauri, and Thanos. Offering the God of Mischief dominion over his brother�s favorite realm Earth, Thanos requested the Tesseract in return. Gifted with a Scepter that acted as a mind control device, Loki would be able to influence others. Unbeknownst to him, the Scepter was also influencing him, fueling his hatred over his brother Thor and the inhabitants of Earth. With the help of the Chitauri, Loki opened a portal to Earth, and it led to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility's underground lab where Dr. Erik Selvig was studying the Tesseract cube, HYDRA�s secret weapon and the key to unlimited stable energy. Powered by the cube, Loki�s Scepter shot energy, disabled most of the agents present, and took control of both Hawkeye and Selvig. The mischief god�s arrival on Earth prompts Director Fury to assemble a response team as Earth�s mightiest heroes, the Avengers.

Still resentful of his brother Thor and refusing to return to Asgard, Loki manipulated Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Director Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., and his brother using the situations to his advantage. Proving himself a formidable threat, Loki ultimately unified and galvanized the disparate group of remarkable people under the Avengers initiative to stop reign."
"With the Tesseract, Loki opened a portal on top of Stark Tower allowing the entire Chitauri army to invade Earth. New York City was overwhelmed and destroyed by the alien fleet. The Avengers ultimately defeated and captured the God of Mischief and the Chitauri and closed the portal. Thor returned to Asgard with his adopted brother in chains as well as the Tesseract.

Condemned to eternal imprisonment, Loki was unaware, above the Asgardian dungeons, of the war raging across the Nine Realms at the hands of Marauders taking advantage of the damaged Bifrost Bridge. Meanwhile on Earth, Jane Foster searching for a portal to Asgard unknowingly entered a gateway during the Convergence, a cosmic alignment of all realms. She became infected with the Aether, also known as the Reality Stone, long thought lost, and awakening Malekith, leader of the Elves.

"
"Malekith turned one of his soldiers into a monstrous Kurse and plotted his capture by the Asgardians. During a skirmish in the Asgardian dungeons, the Kurse revealed himself to Loki as a Dark Elf looking to destroy Asgard. Aiding in his exit, Loki unknowingly led the Dark Elf to his mother Frigga, who was protecting the infected Jane Foster. The news sent Loki into a fit of rage and grief.

Overcome by guilt, Loki agreed to help a solemn Thor seek revenge against the Dark Elves. Anticipating that Loki would turn on him, he planned for every possible betrayal, but did not expect that Loki would sacrifice himself to trick the elves during the Battle of Svartalfheim. He died, and the Elves escaped to Earth with the Aether.

Unbeknownst to Thor, Loki faked his death and returned to Asgard; and so, usurped the Asgardian throne by posing as Odin for some time. After Thor returned to Asgard upon defeating the fire demon Surtur�who was fated to bring Ragnarok, the end of all things, to Asgard�the God of Thunder discovered his brother had been masquerading as the King the entire time. Loki had sent their father to an elderly care center on Midgard. Upon their arrival, the two Asgardian princes discovered the center destroyed. The Master of Mystic Arts Doctor Strange offered to help Thor find his father if they both departed Earth immediately. They agreed, and Strange helped them find their father in Norway."
"The weathered and dying Allfather informed both his sons that he loved them, to Loki�s surprise. However, upon his death, his eldest will be released from her banishment�Hela, the Goddess of Death, a secret he kept from them. As Odin ascended to Valhalla, Hela introduced herself to the two Asgardian princes as the rightful heir to the throne, destroyed Thor�s hammer Mjolnir, and ejected them both from the Bifrost, sending them to Sakaar.

On Sakaar, Loki met and gained favor with the planet�s ruler, the Grandmaster, as well as encountered Scrapper 142, a Valkyrie, part of a legendary force of Asgardian warriors who all perished at the hands of Hela long ago. Refusing to be left on the alien garbage planet full of wormholes with an angry Grandmaster who has lost both Champions, Loki and several escaped Gladiators joined the Revengers (Thor, Hulk, and Valkyrie) on their mission to confront Hela on Asgard."
"While Thor and Valkyrie distracted Hela, Loki infiltrated Odin�s Vault and placed Surtur�s crown in the Eternal Flame, resurrecting the fire demon. On his way out, he considered stealing back the Tesseract, which contained the Space Stone.

As Loki and Thor made amends and discussed plans to remake Asgard on Earth, a large spaceship belonging to Thanos appeared before their Asgardian refugee ship, the Statesman. Thanos demanded the Space Stone from his former ally, Loki. Threatened with his brother�s death, Loki relinquished the Tesseract to Thanos, assuring Thor that the sun would shine on them again, as the Hulk emerged to take on Thanos.

Now that Thanos possesed two Infinity Stones, Loki, calling himself Odinson, offered to be a guide to the Mad Titan and his followers. He pledged his undying fidelity before revealing his true intention�getting close enough to Thanos to attack. However, Thanos predicted Loki�s move and snapped the God of Mischief�s neck in front of his brother, killing him. Loki died telling Thanos he would never be a god.

As the Mad Titan blows up the Statesman with half of the remaining Asgardians and dead Loki, Thor, the only remaining survivor on the ship, believes there will be no more resurrections for his brother and mourns his loss deeply."
"The Mad Titan Thanos quests across the universe in search of the Infinity Stones, intending to use their limitless power for shocking purposes.Using the power of the Infinity Stones, Thanos believes he can ultimately save the universe by wiping out half of its population."
"Heimdall is the guardian of the Bifrost Bridge, and as its gatekeeper, he controls access and travel between Asgard and the other nine realms. With his all-seeing eyes, Heimdall protects Asgard and all of its citizens.An all-seeing Asgardian in charge of guarding the Rainbow Bridge known as the Bifrost, Heimdall's keen skills serve him well as a first line of defense."
"Valkyrie uses her superhuman strength to defend Asgard.Gifted the power of the legendary Asgardian Brunnhilde, Parrington assumed the mantle and the cosmic responsibilities of the Valkyrie"
"The King of Asgard, Odin's immense wisdom helps him battle threats from both outside and within his realm.King of Asgard and protector of the Nine Realms, Odin the All-Father once led with only conquest in mind. Eventually, he recognized the benefits of lasting peace and changed his ways.
"
"A loyal follower of Thanos, Corvus Glaive is a force to be reckoned with as he relentlessly strikes against those in his path.As one of the most direct and brutal members of Thanos� Children, Corvus Glaive enjoys employing tricks and sneak attacks to quickly defeat his targets, using a powerful bladed weapon to do most of his dirty work."
"Proxima Midnight conquers across the galaxy for her master Thanos, with her deadly spear ever ready to strike.As one of the most fierce and formidable warriors in the cosmos, Proxima Midnight mercilessly uses her lethal skills to serve her adopted father Thanos in his quest to obtain all six Infinity Stones and erase half of all life in the universe."
"A brutal and brutish follower of Thanos, this massively strong warrior will do what is needed to accomplish his master�s goals.Among the Children of Thanos, there is one who towers above the rest. Cull, the physically strongest servant of The Mad Titan, decimates enemies using his incredible strength and massive hammer"
"His allegiances may be unclear, but Ebony Maw�s ambitions are not to be doubted. As a henchman of Thanos, Maw can manipulate anyone to bend to his � or Thanos' � will. His powers have the ability to cause trouble for both sides of a battle."
"Everything is a game to this cosmic entity, who loves to pit beings against each other for his own amusement.The Grandmaster is an ancient Elder of the universe that uses his all-encompassing power to force Super Heroes and Villains from across dimensions into his deadly cosmic games."
"Doctor Erik Selvig is a renowned scientist and professor of Astrophysics. Always the cautious scientist, he warns his colleagues of imminent danger, offering a voice of reason."
"Sokovian native Wanda Maximoff and her twin brother Pietro survived an explosion in their apartment building that killed both of their parents. Another missile landed, but did not explode. It terrorized them for days as they remained stuck in the rubble, with the deadly device in front of them, the name Stark emblazed on its side.

Years later, they both volunteered to undergo genetic experimentation overseen by HYDRA�s Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, using Loki�s scepter, to potentially give them powers. One of the few survivors of the experiments, along with her brother, Wanda found herself with a variety of abilities. Alongside Pietro, Wanda went on to use these abilities to help the robot Ultron, who shared her disdain for Tony Stark.

However, when she and Pietro discovered the true nature of Ultron�s plans, they switched allegiances and joined the fight against him, putting Wanda on the path to become an Avenger."
"The full extent of Wanda�s considerable powers has likely not been fully documented as of yet.As her powers likely come at least in part from the Mind Stone inside of Loki�s scepter, Wanda�s abilities include telekinesis, energy manipulation, and some form of neuroelectric interfacing that allows her to both read thoughts and also give her targets waking nightmares. Under the tutelage of Avengers Captain America and Black Widow, she has learned not only to hone her abilities further, but also hand-to-hand combat and tactical skills."
"Wanda Maximoff�s enemies shift significantly as she changes allegiances.

Because Stark missiles kill her parents and nearly kill her and her twin brother Pietro, Wanda spends much of her youth hating Tony Stark. Her initial ally, Ultron, plays off of that rage and manipulates the twins into working for him against the Avengers. However, she comes to see the genocidal Ultron as the true enemy and helps stop his evil scheme. While the relationship between her and Stark does not develop into friendship, they do become teammates as part of the Avengers."
"Wanda later finds a fearsome foe in Thanos, whose goal to gain all six Infinity Stone sets him on a path to Vision, who holds the Mind Stone. Thanos� quest pits Wanda against two of his followers, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive, and eventually Thanos himself. Wanda defeats Proxima Midnight to defend her allies, Black Widow and Okoye. Although Wanda opposes Thanos� goal to end half the life in the universe, he is a much more personal enemy, given her love for Vision and her desire to save his life. She stands staunchly against the Mad Titan in attempt to prevent him from taking the Mind Stone for himself."
"As she becomes an Avenger, Wanda Maximoff develops a good relationship with many in the Super Hero community.

Her first and foremost ally is her twin brother, Pietro Maximoff, who stands by and tries to protect her in the wake of their parents� death. After gaining powers from Baron von Strucker, the Maximoff twins ally themselves with Ultron before fully understanding his villainous plans. Wanda, along with Pietro, switches sides and works with the Avengers, fighting alongside Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Iron Man to oppose the mechanical monster. She is particularly inspired by Hawkeye, who sees a lot of potential in her and becomes a mentor to her. She grieves deeply when Pietro perishes in the fight against Ultron."
"Despite her loss, Wanda becomes a full-fledged Avenger, on a team consisting of Captain America and Black Widow, along with fellow new recruits Falcon, War Machine, and Vision. As time goes on, Vision and Wanda grow closer, an unlikely, but strong, romance eventually blossoms between the two. So strong that Wanda initially refuses to destroy the Mind Stone in Vision�s forehead, despite knowing that the fate of the universe hangs on this decision."
"Having undergone HYDRA boss� Baron von Strucker�s experiments, Wanda Maximoff exhibited telekinetic and mental manipulation powers, while her twin brother Pietro could run at super speeds. The twins proved to be the only subjects to survive the process and were initially held in cells as they began getting used to their new powers.

Over time, Wanda and Pietro gained more control of their abilities, and when the Avengers attacked the HYDRA base in Sokovia to reclaim Loki's scepter, they both got in on the action. Wanda blasted Captain America down a flight of stairs and used her neuroelectric interfacing powers to show Tony Stark his worst nightmare. While Strucker and his men were detained, Wanda escaped with Pietro.

Soon after, the two encountered the robot Ultron, who had been brought to life by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, and agreed to help him bring down the Avengers. Ultron informed Wanda that she would be the key to tearing the group apart from the inside.

She made great strides in that effort in a battle in South Africa, using her mental manipulation powers to throw Thor, Captain America and Black Widow off their game, plaguing them with waking nightmares, though Hawkeye fought off her attempt. Wanda then used her powers to turn Banner into the Hulk and sent him on a rampage that only Iron Man could stop with the help of his Hulkbuster armor."
"From there, Ultron brought the Maximoffs with him to Seoul so he could force Dr. Helen Cho into making a Vibranium-laced body for him in her Cradle. With the creation process a success, Ultron removed the Mind Stone from Loki's scepter and placed it on the new form's forehead. However, he still needed to go through the process of downloading his digital essence into the new body. During that time, Wanda could see Ultron's full plans and realized that he intended to kill nearly everyone on Earth, not just the Avengers.

Wanda managed to use her powers to free Dr. Cho before escaping with Pietro. When Captain America took on Ultron, the twins assisted him in the battle and then helped stop a runaway train, saving the passengers onboard.

Taken to Avengers headquarters with her brother, Wanda was present for the creation of Vision, and was cautious of this new being. She and Pietro then agreed to return to Sokovia to help the Avengers stop Ultron."
"When the battle began in Sokovia, Wanda briefly felt overwhelmed, only to receive words of wisdom from Hawkeye, who told her that it would be okay to hide but that if she truly joined the fight, she'd be an Avenger. Wanda dug deep and decided on the latter, unleashing her power on Ultron�s sentries."
"As the fight continued, Pietro was killed saving Hawkeye and a child. Wanda felt the loss of her twin as it happened, and devastated, let loose a huge blast of destructive power. After Hulk threw Ultron from his intended escape plane, Wanda tracked him down and literally ripped his robotic heart out to make him feel what she had at Pietro�s loss. Wanda was nearly killed herself as Sokovia was destroyed, but Vision swooped in and rescued her.

After Ultron�s defeat, Wanda agreed to move to upstate New York and live in the new Avengers Headquarters. This was so she could continue as a member of the team and also train with Captain America and Black Widow, alongside Vision, Falcon, and War Machine.

On a mission in Lagos to stop Brock Rumlow, AKA Crossbones, from stealing a deadly biological agent, Wanda was present as Rumlow set off a bomb, intending to kill both himself and Captain America. Wanda instinctively used her powers to send the bomb into the air, saving her leader, but inadvertently killing innocents in the upper floor of a building."
"While Rogers tried to console her, Wanda�s actions turned out to be the straw that broke the camel�s back when it came to fallout from Super Hero related incidents. After this, the Avengers were informed about the Sokovia Accords, which would put the team under the oversight of the United Nations. This proposal tore the team apart with Iron Man and his supporters wanting to sign it and Captain America and his side refusing.

As Cap went rogue, Wanda initially stayed with Stark. However, even as she continued to bond with Vision, she was troubled when he made it clear that she could not leave the property on Stark�s orders.Sent by Cap, Hawkeye came to retrieve Wanda, who wasn�t sure if she should go, but Hawkeye told her that she couldn't make amends from inside a makeshift prison. Wanda then used her powers to stop Vision from choking Barton out and sent him through several layers of the compound so they could escape."
"In the battle that followed in Berlin between Rogers and Stark�s factions, Wanda proved herself a valuable teammate for Captain America�s group, taking on everyone from Iron Man to Spider-Man to Black Widow, while chastising Hawkeye for holding back against his friends. When she was injured during the fight, Vision would impulsively come to her aid, distracted so much by her being hurt that he inadvertently blasted his own teammate, James �Rhodey� Rhodes/War Machine, permanently disabling him in the process. With only Cap and Bucky Barnes escaping, Wanda and the others who fought with Captain America found themselves locked up in the underwater prison called the Raft, though Rogers would find them and break them out soon after.Now a fugitive, Wanda would begin to periodically sneak off when she could with Vision, who was still working alongside Stark but ever-evolving, and the two found themselves in a romantic relationship. During one of these encounters, in Scotland, Vision brought up the idea of them staying together and leaving their other lives behind. This conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive, there to retrieve Vision of the Mind Stone for Thanos. While Vision found his powers diminished by Glaive�s weapon, Wanda made a strong stand against her two powerful foes, and then got back-up from her arriving teammates Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon."
"After the group returned to the upstate New York Avengers compound and reunited with James Rhodes and Bruce Banner, Vision suggested Wanda use her powers to destroy the Mind Stone in order to keep it from Thanos, at the cost of his own life. Both Maximoff and Rogers rejected the idea, with Banner suggesting that Vision may not need the stone to survive, but that the procedure to remove it without harming him was beyond his skill set.The Avengers then traveled to Wakanda to utilize their advanced technology and science. With Thanos� army coming for the stone, Wanda stood by as the brilliant Wakandan Shuri worked to remove the stone, waiting to destroy it once the procedure was done. However, when she saw horrific vehicles begin to decimate her friends and the Wakandans that fought with them, Wanda leapt into action and used her powers to turn the devices against Thanos� army. While Proxima Midnight briefly knocked her out, Wanda awakened in time to help Black Widow and Okoye, killing Proxima Midnight."
"With Wanda gone, Thanos� agents moved in on Vision, whose procedure was interrupted, as he joined the fight as well.

When Thanos himself arrived in Wakanda, Vision told Wanda she needed to use her powers to destroy the Stone, despite the fact that it would end his life. Overcoming her grief, she began to use her power to destroy the stone while simultaneously holding Thanos back after he�d effortlessly stopped all other attempts to quell his attack. The stone shattered, and both it and Vision exploded. However, Wanda then could do nothing to stop Thanos from using the Time Stone to instantly bring Vision back into existence simply so he could tear the Mind Stone from his head, leaving him a lifeless husk.

Moments later, now having gained possession of all six Infinity Stones, Thanos snapped his fingers, ending half the life in the universe. As she sat by the body of Vision, mourning him, Wanda Maximoff�s body disintegrated into nothing."
"Five years after being vanished by Thanos, Wanda returned to life in Wakanda thanks to the efforts of her fellow Avengers. While everyone who had been disappeared demanded vengeance for their lost time, Wanda had an extra level of rage burning for the Titan because of what she had to do to Vision. With that in mind, and seemingly nothing else, Wanda unleashed on the time-traveling version she encountered on the battlefield. Wanda was able to hold her own against Thanos, dismantling the Mad Titan's armor with her powers. However, her efforts were thwarted after he opened fire from his ships above on her and the rest of the Avengers.

"
"Luckily for everyone in existence, Tony Stark did finally manage to gain control of the new Infinity Gauntlet and used it to remove Thanos and his forces from the board. Along with her fellow heroes, Wanda mourned the loss of the first modern Avenger at the wake held by Pepper Potts. 

Wanda Maximoff aimed her anger and grief over loss of her parents at Tony Stark, which drove her to HYDRA�where she gained powers�which drove her further to Ultron, where she gained perspective. Seeing the error of her ways, Wanda switched sides."
"Once a highly successful, yet notably egotistical, surgeon, Doctor Stephen Strange endured a terrible accident that led him to evolve in ways he could have never foreseen. Vain, egotistic surgeon Stephen Strange lost the use of his hands in a horrific auto accident caused by his own recklessness. In turn, he lost his fortune through a series of costly, complicated and experimental surgeries and therapies in an attempt to save his livelihood. In the end, destitute and desperate, he sought a cure far off the beaten path of modern medicine.

In Nepal, after being saved from muggers by the powerful sorcerer Mordo, Strange met the person who had taught Mordo�Earth�s Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, who held many mysteries of the Old World, including the potential to heal Strange�s hands. The Ancient One refused to guide Strange through the process until he relinquished his selfishness and opened his mind to a higher truth. Having done so, the doctor began to learn of the Multiverse and the ancient science of magic, as well as forbidden knowledge the Ancient One was not inclined to share."
"A Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange has phenomenally powerful magical abilities that enable him to skillfully conjure myriad spells. Strange has been able to use his spells to bind opponents and create complex shields and barriers, among many other uses for both defense and attack. Strange is also adept at astral projection, sending his astral self away from his body and allowing him to observe events without the knowledge of those present.

Strange discovers that certain artifacts can bolster magical spells and extend their benefits. At the New York Sanctum, he is adopted by the Cloak of Levitation, a seemingly sentient cape that not only protects him, but also fights for him. The doctor also makes use of Sling Rings to create portals to cross great distances and to enter other realms.

Arguably, the Eye of Agamotto provides the greatest source of power to Strange. In truth the Infinity Stone known as the Time Stone, the Eye possesses the incalculable ability to control time itself. With it, Strange can alter time around objects, locations or other beings, moving forward and backward through their existence. It can also be used to trap enemies in time loops, as well as giving Strange the ability to look forward into potential futures.

"
"Strange accelerates his mystical learning by mastering the use of his astral form, but as he dips deeper into magic, he encounters Kaecilius, a former student of the Ancient One and a disciple of Dormammu, a powerful entity from the Dark Dimension. Though still a relative novice, Strange opposes Kaecilius and his followers when they reveal their plans to bring Dormammu to Earth for utter destruction. At this same time, Strange also learns of Earth�s magical hierarchy, including a trio of Sanctums placed around the globe and overseen by Masters to protect the planet from magical threats.

Later, Thanos and his mission to acquire all six Infinity Stones poses a direct threat to Strange and the Time Stone in his possession, putting Strange into conflict with Thanos� followers Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian as well."
"In his struggle with Kaecilius and Dormammu, Strange finds himself aided by Mordo, another accomplished student of the Ancient One, and Wong, a Master who watched over the Ancient One�s library in Nepal. Mordo proves himself a staunch ally until he witnesses his teacher�s use of magic she herself had forbidden and loses faith in her guidance. After Strange�s defeat of Dormammu, Wong travels with him to a Sanctum in New York City to stand at his side for the uncertain times ahead.

The Ancient One falls due to the treachery of Kaecilius, and though she wielded dark magic to further the cause of good, she dies urging Stephen Strange to continue his magical studies and become a champion for Earth.

Doctor Christine Palmer and Strange once dated, and she offers him assistance and comfort in the wake of his accident, only to be rejected by him at his darkest point. He does care for and trust her, as later, Strange seeks her medical expertise when he himself�and later the Ancient One�are injured during his battles. He also reveals his magical abilities to her and apologizes for how he�d once acted.

"Following his months of training at the Ancient One�s compound in Nepal, Strange entered into a series of skirmishes with Kaecilius, Dormammu�s agent on Earth, and his followers. This included an invasion of the New York Sanctum, where Strange witnessed the death of that Sanctum�s guardian at Kaecilius� hands. During the fight that followed, Strange would be saved by the Cloak of Levitation, but was badly wounded by Kaecilius� follower, Lucian.

Strange transported himself to Metro-General Hospital, where he enlisted Christine Palmer to operate on him while he simultaneously battled Lucian in the Astral Plane�and revealed his Astral Projection and newfound magical abilities to Christine in the process. In the wake of this, Strange felt regret at having had to kill Lucian to survive their battle, while learning from the Ancient One that he was the New York Sanctum�s new Master."

"With Kaecilius� own formidable power allowing him to continually subvert Strange�s attempts to stop him, Strange took the fight directly to Dormammu. Confronting the powerful entity in his own Dark Dimension, the doctor enacted a clever ploy using the Eye�s time-twisting powers to trap Dormammu and himself in a time loop. This forced Dormammu to retreat and abandon his schemes to annex Earth into his dimensional holdings, and take Kaecilius and his followers with him in the process. However, Mordo, disillusioned by what he learned about the Ancient One before she died, left to walk his own path.

Back in the New York Sanctum he was now Master of, Strange, aided by Wong, set about learning all he could to contribute to his new-found position as Earth�s Master of the Mystic Arts. This included keeping track of otherworldly visitors to the planet and, if possible, their purpose there. This mission brought him into contact with Thor and his brother Loki when they sought their father Odin on Earth, a quest to which Strange was able to impart some assistance, sending them to their father�s side.

Later, Doctor Strange enlisted the help of Tony Stark after the Hulk crashed into the New York Sanctum. Having transformed back into Bruce Banner, he informed Doctor Strange of the dreaded tyrant Thanos� accelerated drive to collect all six Infinity Stones�including the Time Stone housed within the Eye of Agamotto. Strange and Stark both took an immediate dislike to each other, but when Thanos� lackeys arrived in the city, the two men, joined by Wong and Spider-Man, fought side-by-side to block the aliens� march of destruction. Despite their strong opposition, Strange was captured and removed to the aliens� spaceship, though both Iron Man and Spider-Man were able to sneak onto the ship before it left Earth�s atmosphere."

"When Iron Man was beaten in battle by Thanos and about to be killed, Strange stopped him, sacrificing the Eye of Agamotto to the alien warlord to save Stark�s life, despite Stark�s protests. With the Time Stone in his possession, Thanos left Titan to travel to Earth and secure the last remaining Infinity Stone he sought. His success in the endeavor was soon evident to the heroes still on Titan when many of them�along with half of all life throughout the universe�began to crumble into dust. As Doctor Strange felt himself begin to disintegrate away into nothingness, he comforted Tony Stark about the sacrifice he�d made, explaining that there was �no other way.�

"A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid abilities and instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help others with them. An orphan living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as not to burden her with his actions.

Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices he�d constructed, Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the attention of Tony Stark. The billionaire industrialist deduced Spider-Man�s secret identity and approached Parker at his and May�s home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and associates. Parker was initially hesitant to even admit his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and Stark�s talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation, as well as a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters."
"Peter Parker�s gifts from the spider bite include enhanced strength, stamina, and agility, as well as the ability to cling to nearly any surface by his hands and feet, and an internal �alarm� of sorts that warns him of impending danger. When in costume he becomes a figure in motion, leaping and jumping about with a steady stream of wisecracks.

The Spider-Man suit designed by Tony Stark includes wrist-worn web-shooters (adapted from Peter�s own invention) that emit lines of synthetic �webbing� capable of supporting great weight with a high-degree of holding power. In addition, the suit provides various optical powers, a voice-changer, a drone tracking device, and some protection against outside elements. When not in use, the suit appears as loose, thin cloth, but when donned, it adheres tightly to the body and stretches easily to almost any movement by the wearer.

Recently, Parker acquires a specialized suit of armor from Stark that features many qualities of the inventor�s own Iron Man suits, including enhanced protective layering, optics, internal air supply, along with a set of four spider-like extra �arms� that answer to the teenager�s mental commands."
"Spider-Man has yet to attract a sizable Rogues Gallery, but his first real Super Villain adversary is Adrian Toomes, the Vulture.

Over the course of Spider-Man�s interactions with the Vulture, he advanced from a nuisance in Toomes� eyes to a true obstruction in the man�s schemes. Toomes also perhaps saw a bit of himself in Spider-Man, albeit at a younger age. Unfortunately, the Vulture discovered his foe�s secret identity and was able to initially warn Parker off with threats toward his family and friends. But, the young man�s sense of responsibility and justice outweighed any fear and he did everything within his power to ensure that Toomes never flew again. Now in prison, the Vulture still harbors Spider-Man�s secret, though he had decided to keep that to himself as an apparent sign of respect towards his enemy.

In addition to the Vulture himself, two of his associates may also still cause trouble for Spider-Man: Herman Schultz, AKA the Shocker, who wields a powerful gauntlet inherited from his late colleague, Jackson Brice, and Mac Gargan, a dangerous criminal who was injured in a confrontation with Spider-Man. Both men have been incarcerated, but Gargan in particular seems eager to enact his revenge on New York�s young champion.

When Thanos made his play for the Infinity Stones, Spider-Man, coming to Iron Man�s aid, placed himself in direct opposition to both Thanos and those who serve him."
"May Parker took her nephew in to raise him as if he was her own son and has instilled values in Peter Parker that serve him well. So close are the two that he worries over hurting May with his Spider-Man activities and feels the pain of lying to her. May is easygoing to some extent, but is quick to let her nephew know when she is unhappy with any situation he may be involved in.

As a student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology, Parker enjoys only a very small circle of friends, partially due to his extracurricular time as Spider-Man. His best friend is his classmate Ned, who discovers Spider-Man�s secret identity by accident and is in complete awe over the details of Parker�s costumed career. During Spider-Man�s first real adventure involving a major adversary, Ned provides valuable support, despite his seemingly bumbling demeanor."
"Peter Parker�s kindhearted first crush, Liz, led to Peter�s shocking discovery that her father was his enemy, Adrian Toomes, and Liz�s departure not only from Peter�s school, but also from the city with her family. Spider-Man maintains a mentor-student relationship with Tony Stark, even through ups and downs between them, due to Parker�s rebellious streak and his desire to be just like Stark when it comes to heroics."
"After securing Peter Parker�s promise of help in the aftermath of the Sokovia Accords, Tony Stark flew the teenager to Germany under the pretense, to his aunt, of a scholarship program and internship. Once there, Parker suited up in his new Stark-created Spider-Man gear and joined the confrontation under Stark�s direction against the rogue heroes. Though a self-professed fan of Captain America, Parker temporarily stole the man�s famous shield at the onset of the battle, and later regretted having to clash with him and his companions. Overall, Spider-Man held his own against the Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and toppled a giant-size Ant-Man. He was taken out of the fight when Ant-Man accidentally struck him while falling, however. Stark ordered Parker to stand down for the rest of the action."
"Upon returning to Queens, Parker explained away his injuries as the result of a brawl he�d been in; May assumed that it was with fellow students. In reality, the young man looked forward to more battles, despite Stark�s seeming reluctance to involve him in any future battles.

Finally, after growing frustrated with the lack of direct communication with Stark, and itching to be useful as Spider-Man, Parker returned to crimefighting on the streets of his neighborhood. As fate would have it, he came across a group of criminals robbing a bank with weapons left over from the alien Chitauri invasion of New York. In the process of confronting them, however, he accidentally destroyed a nearby establishment. To make matters worse, Parker�s friend, Ned, discovered his Spider-Man secret. Tony Stark also personally warned Parker to curtail his Super Hero activities and his campaign against the Vulture, the man responsible for supplying high tech weaponry to criminals.

Together, Parker and Ned figured out a way to track the criminals� power source. After discovering it led to Washington D.C., the location of an upcoming school trip, the young hero went along as part of a science competition team. After a harrowing experience at the Washington Monument with a Chitauri explosive, Parker returned to New York and tracked the Vulture to a deal on the Staten Island Ferry. Iron Man jetted in to help when the ensuing fight threatened to sink the ferry and kill those onboard; later Stark warned Parker again, in no uncertain terms, that his career as a Super Hero was over. To ensure Parker took him seriously, he also took back the Spider-Man suit."
"Dejected, Peter Parker turned back to his school activities and asked the girl of his dreams, Liz, to accompany him to the Homecoming dance. The night of the dance, he learned that Liz�s father is Adrian Toomes, the Vulture, and in turn, Toomes learned that he was Spider-Man. Toomes warned Parker to stay away, but the young man, wearing his original homemade Spider-Man costume, stubbornly refused to give up and battled his foe all the way into the air and on top of a plane carrying Stark weapons the Vulture attempted to hijack.

Upon defeating his adversary, Spider-Man left him for the police and prepared to face Tony Stark�s wrath. Instead, impressed by the growth he had seen, Stark commended him for his victory, and offered Parker a new, upgraded Spider-Man suit and full Avengers membership. However, Peter had reevaluated how quickly he was trying to raise his status and politely declined Stark�s offer, deciding to stay a local hero for the time being. Returning home, he discovered Stark had returned the suit he�d taken back from him earlier, and Peter donned it again, only to be stumbled upon by May.

When Thanos� followers came to Earth to acquire the Infinity Stones harbored there, Spider-Man aided Iron Man and Doctor Strange in confronting the powerful being. Wanting to try to save Strange when he was abducted by the aliens, he stubbornly disobeyed Stark�s orders to stay behind and hitched a ride on the departing starship�ultimately given an assist by the upgraded, armored suit Stark had made for him that he�d once turned down while declining Avengers membership."
"Together, Parker, Stark, and Strange travelled to the dead world of Titan, where they met members of the Guardians of the Galaxy and prepared a plan to keep Thanos from getting Strange�s own Infinity Stone. The plan failed and the tyrant left Titan with the Stone, going on to gain the sixth and final Infinity Stone on Earth. Having done so, with a snap of his fingers, Thanos caused half of all life throughout the Universe to end. On Titan, those affected included Peter Parker, who could feel something was happening to him. Peter told Tony Stark he didn�t want to go and that he was sorry before disintegrating into nothingness in Stark�s arms.
