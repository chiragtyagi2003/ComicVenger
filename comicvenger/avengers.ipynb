              "  This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative.\n",

              "      <th>This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative.</th>\n",

              "      <th>This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative.</th>\n",

              "  This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

              "      <th>This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative.</th>\n",

              "      <th>This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative.</th>\n",

              "  This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

              "      <th>This is dated earliest of all the Marvel movies. In 1942, Steve Rogers is a small skinny dude, his close buddy is Bucky. Due to his physicality, Rogers is rejected for the World War II military but is persistent. Dr. Abraham Erskine, head of the Super Soldier program, overhears Rogers and deems him a suitable candidate because of his selfless nature. Rogers is ultimately picked for the program and becomes tall, muscular, super strong, agile .. the works and becomes Captain America.\\n\\nA while before this, a Nazi officer, Johann Schmidt (also a Hydra operative), had gone through an imperfect version of the Super Soldier program. Schmidt get his hands on the Tesseract. He intends to harness its powers to build weapons and destroy all of America. Howard Stark (Tony Stark�s dad), gives Cap a Vibranium shield. Schmidt, whose plans are foiled by Cap, reveals that his face was merely a mask covering his Red Skull.\\n\\nIn one of the missions on a train, Bucky falls to his apparent death (no he doesn�t die, he comes back in Winter Soldier). In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull�s plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon. Red Skull touches the Tesseract which opens a wormhole and sucks him through (he doesn�t die, Red Skull returns in Infinity War). The Tesseract falls into the ocean, and Captain America sacrifices himself by crashing the plane in the Arctic. He doesn�t die, he gets cryogenically frozen. Howard Stark retrieves the Tesseract but is unable to find Cap. Howard eventually becomes one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap remains frozen for 70 years.Nick Fury talks to Cap, who has been asleep for 70 years, about the Avenger�s initiative.</th>\n",

In the climax of the film, Cap gets on board Red Skull\\\\ufffds plane which is armed with the Tesseract weapon.

Over time, a Kree by the name of Mar-Vell somehow infiltrates S.H.I.E.L.D under the name of Dr. Wendy Lawson. She becomes the head of Project Pegasus and relocates the Tesseract to her secret lab in space.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Wendy continues to work as part of Project Pegasus to create a Light-Speed Engine. She doesn\\\\ufffdt approve of her people obliterating the Skrulls (a race of shape-shifters). She wants to hand the Skrulls the Light-Speed Engine so they can escape. She\\\\ufffds also secretly stowed away a bunch of Skrulls in her Space Lab. Before she can complete her work, a Kree squadron, lead by Yon-Rogg, finds her in 1989.\\\\n\\\\nMar-Vell asks a young pilot, Carol Danvers, to accompany her and the two of them get shot down. This plane has a Jet Engine that Mar-Vell has built, and is powered by the Tesseract. Yon-Rogg kills Mar-Vell. Carol blows up the jet engine. Somehow, she ends up absorbing all the energy from the explosion. Given the closest thing to the Light-Speed Engine has been blown up, Yon-Rogg takes Carol with him as she might be the key to figuring out the Engine. The Kree use Carol\\\\ufffds amnesia to make her believe she is a Kree too. To keep her powers at bay, they put an inhibitor on her. Six years pass.\\\\n\\\\nIn one of the missions in 1995, Carol is captured by the Skrulls who are trying to get to the location of the Secret Lab. Long story short, Carol ends up on Earth, runs into a young Nick Fury, finds the lab, remembers her Earth life, realizes the Skrulls are good, gets the Tesseract (which is gobbled by an alien cat), removes her inhibitor, unleashes her full powers, takes down all of the Kree, and set the Skrulls free. The exotic cat scratches Nick Fury\\\\ufffds eye causing him to lose it, and he gets his famous eye patch. Carol gives Nick Fury a pager-on-steroids which he is to use only in case of a vital emergency.The alien cat spits up the Tesseract. This is how S.H.I.E.L.D repossess the Tesseract after it has been in Mar Vell\\\\ufffds secret lab.

In the cave, where Tony is kept, is another captive, Dr. Yinsen, who implants an electromagnet into Tony\\\\ufffds chest to keep the shards out of his heart.

Yinsen sacrifices himself and Tony blows his way out destroying the terrorist camp.\\\\n\\\\nTony gets found by his friend Colonel James Rhodes and begins work on a more advanced suit powered by a more powerful arc reactor.

As a result, when Bruce is angry, he transforms into the Hulk. In this film, Bruce is lying low in Brazil, working in a bottling plant. But due to a small cut on his hands, his blood happens to get into one of the bottles.This bottle eventually causes a death by gamma poisoning and is traced back to Bruce. General Ross and Emil Blonsky want to weaponize the Hulk and hence try to capture Bruce. But they lose to the Hulk. Blonsky is initially given a small dose of the low-power super-soldier serum, this makes him stronger and gives him healing powers, but he begins losing his mind. After multiple defeats at the hands of the hulk, Blonsky finally gets Banner\\\\ufffds blood injected into him. The combination of the super-soldier serum and the infected gamma blood transforms Blonsky into a mindless beast ? Abomination. The Hulk battles the Abomination and kills him.

Loki is this brother. For rupturing the truce between Asgard and Jotunheim, Odin exiles Thor to Earth after stripping him off all the Godly powers. Thor�s hammer, the source of his power, is enchanted such that only the worthy can wield it. Thor gets separated from his hammer. While the hammer is found by S.H.I.E.L.D, Thor is found by Dr. Jane Foster and Dr. Erik Selvig.Thor manages to get to the hammer but is unable to lift it because he�s not worthy. Back in Asgard, Loki finds out that he�s adopted. While Odin enters his deep slumber, Loki takes over the throne. Thor�s friends don�t like this and convince the gatekeeper of the Bifr?st (rainbow bridge transportation thingy), Heimdall, to send them to Earth. Loki gets to know of this and sends the Destroyer (an indestructible metallic being thingy) to Earth to kill Thor.The Destroyer defeats Thor�s friends, but he offers himself as a sacrifice and is struck. Because of his worthy actions, Thor�s hammer returns to him. Thor destroys the Destroyer and heads back to Asgard to confront Loki. The two of them fight, and Thor blows up the Bifr?st bridge so that no one can enter Asgard and invade it. Odin awakens and stops Thor and Loki from falling into the emptiness under the bridge. Loki commits suicide by letting himself fall off (no he doesn�t die, he returns in The Avengers). Thor and Odin reconcile, but Thor is stuck on Asgard.

Loki, who faked his death, makes a deal with the leader of a race called Chitauri. Loki is offered an army in exchange for the Tesseract (Space Stone) that�s on Earth. It�s important to know that Thanos is the one who�s firing the shots here. Via the Chitauri, Thanos has given Loki a mighty Sceptre to aid him in the mission of getting the Tesseract. This Sceptre contains the Mind Stone, but no one knows about this but Thanos. Loki is able to control minds using the Sceptre.The film begins with Loki taking over Dr. Selvig and Hawk-Eye�s minds and stealing the Tesseract from Nick Fury. Natasha goes to India looking for Bruce Banner because the Tesseract is giving out gamma radiations which she�s hoping Bruce can trace. Long story short, Loki uses the Tesseract to open a portal and the Chitauri attack. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawk-Eye, and Natasha team together as the Avengers and fight off the aliens. Leaders of Earth decide the best way to end the invasion is to blow up New York and launch a nuke. Iron Man deflects this missile through the worm-hole and blows up the Chitauri mothership. Dr. Selvig and Natasha use the Sceptre to close the portal (one Infinity Stone vs. another, but no one knows about these stones yet). Iron Man falls back through the closing portal just in time, and Hulk grabs him midway. Thor takes Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard.

Now, there is an event that aligns all the nine realms together once every 5000 years. It� s called Convergence.Malekith tries to use the Aether to darken the world in a previous convergence, but is stopped by Thor�s granddad. Hence Malekith puts himself and few other Dark Elves in a state of hibernation. In the present day, as the next convergence approaches, portals begin to randomly appear in the 9 realms.Jane goes to investigate one such portal and gets sucked into the realm where the Aether has been kept hidden from Malekith. Jane activates the Aether by mistake, and it enters her. This awakens Malekith and the other hibernating Dark Elves. The Aether begins to kill Jane because of its power. Long story short ? Thor takes Jane to Asgard, Malekith attacks Asgard to get Jane, Thor�s mother dies protecting Jane, Loki joins forces with Thor to avenge his mother, Loki tricks Malekith by bringing Thor and Jane as his prisoners, Malekith extracts the Aether from Jane, Loki dies (no he doesn�t, Loki is faking it again, he�ll be back in the end), Thor and Malekith fight through the various portals, Thor finally kills Malekith.

In this film, we are shown that a meteorite hit a place in Africa thousands of years ago. This meteorite contained the metal Vibranium (the one Cap�s shield is made from). One warrior eats a heart-shaped herb affected by the metal and gains super-human strength. Thus is formed the kingdom of Wakanda under the leadership of this warrior.\\n\\nOver generations, they use the Vibranium to become highly advanced but remain hidden. When T�Challa is a young boy, his uncle begins dealing with Ulysses Klaue and supplying him Vibranium; now we know how Klaue provided Ultron with the metal. The uncle wants to empower all the people from Africa across the world with weapons to rise against their oppressors. T�Challa�s father kills his brother and abandons his brother�s child, Erik, to grow up as an orphan. Erik (Killmonger) learns about the real Wakanda from his father�s journals and eventually joins the black-ops.\\n\\nAfter the events of Civil War, T�Challa returns to Wakanda to become king. He faces M�Baku in ritualistic combat to the death and defeats him but doesn�t kill him. Erik initially appears to be working with Klaue. A CIA agent, Everett, gets involved and is severely wounded while trying to arrest Klaue. T�Challa decides to take Everett back to Wakanda to save his life. Erik kills Klaue, shows up in Wakanda, and announces who he is. He challenges T�Challa and defeats him, throws him over a waterfall, and becomes king. He also consumes the herb to turn super-powered. Erik picks up where his father left off and commissions jets to fly out Vibranium to dealers in America. T�Challa is saved by M�Baku as a repayment. T�Challa�s family revive him by giving him the last of the heart-shaped-herb. In a final showdown with the Black Panther, Erik is killed. Everett remote pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the Vibranium. After this, T�Challa announces at the UN the truth about Wakanda.T�Challa�s sister, Shuri, is working on getting Bucky free of his brainwashing.',\n",

The Eternals succeed in eradicating all the Deviants by the 1500s, or so they think. A bunch of Deviants get preserved in ice.\\n\\nThe Eternals live their lives on Earth, waiting for a message from Arishem stating their mission is complete. Hundreds of years pass, and in the present day, the Eternals come to know that Earth is one of many host planets for the seed of a Celestial. Once the intelligent life reaches a particular threshold, the Celestial will emerge from the core, and the planet will be destroyed.\\n\\nArishem later reveals that he created the Deviants to eliminate apex predators from planets so that intelligent life could develop. But Deviants evolved and began destroying all life. To stop them, Arishem created the Eternals to kill Deviants. After each emergence, the memories of Eternals are wiped clean, and they are assigned another planet.\\n\\nDeviants get free from the ice and attack the Eternals and absorb their powers. Ikaris turns against the Eternals, who plan to kill the Celestial, but is unable to stop Sersi as he loves her. In the end, the surviving Eternals form a Uni-Mind and freeze and kill the emerging Celestial.  Eros (Thanos� brother), a.k.a Starfox, enters the Domo with Pip The Troll, and they offer to help find Sersi, Kingo and Phastos.Sersi�s boyfriend, Dane, is about to pick up a cursed ancestral sword called the Ebony Blade. Once he does, he will become the Black Knight, but Dane is stopped by a voice that asks, �Sure you�re ready for that, Mr Whitman?�. This person is Blade, once portrayed by Wesley Snipes back in the 90s.',\n",

Peter agrees and stops Strange from returning The Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Sandman, The Lizard and Electro and tries to fix them with the help of Stark tech. Only Doc Ock�s chip is successfully replaced and it all backfires when Goblin provokes the rest and flees after killing Aunt May. \\n\\nThe most iconic moments in comic films history happens when the other two Spider-Men come to the aid of Peter, and the three team up to take down and fix the bad guys. Strange says the spell is uncontainable, and far too many intruders from other universes start encroaching. Peter asks Strange to make everyone forget him, which stops the convergence of the multiverse. The Spider-Men bid goodbye and Peter Parker begins a new life where no one knows him, and he swings away into the night.

With Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver fighting by their side, the Avengers arrived, taking down hordes of Ultron drones, while attempting to get as many civilians to safety as they could�eventually aided by War Machine and Nick Fury, Maria Hill, and other former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents whose Helicarrier was invaluable in getting Sokovians off the floating city. The majority of Sokovians were rescued, even as the Avengers were forced to blow up the city in order to save the Earth. Ultron, in the meantime, was stopped completely, as all of his sentries were destroyed, with Vision taking out the final robot before it could escape. The aftermath of this battle created a lot of changes to the Avengers roster. Although he might have joined, Pietro was killed in the battle protecting Hawkeye.

Thor returned to the cosmos to investigate the unsettling number of events involving Infinity Stones, while Tony Stark decided to take a step back from the team.\\n\\nNow working out of a new headquarters owned by Stark in upstate New York, Captain America and Black Widow formed a second incarnation of the Avengers, comprised of the two of them and new recruits Vision, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, and War Machine.\\n\\nDuring a mission in Lagos to stop Crossbones (Brock Rumlow), Scarlet Witch, acting to save Captain America when Rumlow set off an explosive device intended to kill both himself and Cap, used her powers to send the explosive hurtling into the air�accidently killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers when the explosion hit the building they were in. Wracked with guilt over this event and others, Tony, working with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, backed the introduction of the Sokovia Accords. Agreed upon by the United Nations, the Accords� purpose was to create oversight when it comes to the actions of the Avengers, meaning a UN panel would be able to control what missions they took and what parts of the world they traveled to.  The Accords caused a major rift between Tony and Steve Rogers, who strongly opposed them. Both recruited heroes to their sides after Rogers old friend, Bucky Barnes, was framed for the bombing of the Accords ratification summit, which resulted in the death of Wakanda�s king, T�Chaka. The situation escalated, as Rogers was actively helping a wanted criminal avoid the authorities, made worse by Barnes� past as the brainwashed HYDRA assassin called the Winter Soldier, whose body count was infamous long before the UN summit was bombed.Standing with Stark to bring in Rogers, Barnes, and their allies were Rhodes, Vision, and Romanoff, while Wakanda�s Prince T�Challa, the Black Panther, and Spider-Man (Peter Parker), were also recruited to help.

After Drax was convinced that Gamora too, despite her previous affiliation, was an enemy of Thanos and Ronan, the five outlaws broke out together. On Knowhere, the group met with their buyer, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector. He revealed to them that the Orb held the Power Stone, an Infinity Stone capable of mowing down entire civilizations. Before their deal was completed, Tivan�s slave, Carina, attempting to strike back at Tivan, grabbed for the stone, only for it kill her and destroy Tivan�s museum. The sale to Tivan disrupted, the group debated what to do with the Orb, with Gamora insisting that it go to the Nova Corp and stay out of Ronan�s hands.\\n\\nWhen both Ronan and Yondu separately arrived seeking the outlaws and the Orb, a space battle ensued.

Quill exited his pod to save Gamora, nearly sacrificing himself in the process. After Yondu took Quill and Gamora onboard his ship, Quill convinced Yondu to partner with them against Ronan, promising him the Orb when Ronan was defeated. When Rocket, Groot, and Drax arrived to save their new teammates, they learned of this new plan, as Quill begged the group to help him save the galaxy. Realizing the odds against them, Rocket noted Quill was essentially asking them to die, but even he relented and joined the others in their pledge to help.\\n\\nIn the battle that followed on and above Xandar, Groot showed his true prowess as a fighter, slaying a large group of Ronan�s men, while Nebula fled after a fight with Gamora.

King T�Challa of Wakanda, AKA Black Panther, becomes the new Chairman of the Avengers team. In need of support staff, he handpicks a new squad to help him out: the Agents of Wakanda. T�Challa kicks off his recruiting process with General Okoye by reaching out to former environmental S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Rosalind �Roz� Solomon who could use a new outlet for her background in spy work.\\n\\nOkoye gives Roz a tour of Agents of Wakanda�s headquarters in Wakanda, introducing her to other new recruits and shows her the weapons room, replete with advanced weaponry, guns containing Vibranium bullets, and a vehicle that can teleport. Since the agents are support staff for the Avengers, Wakandan HQ is connected to theirs at Avengers Mountain, which is run out of a Dark Celestial�s corpse. Therefore, they can use the Celestial energy to teleport between the two locations and various spots around the globe.

They stop him from destroying the town, but receive a startling report from Broo and Gorilla-Man who discovered strange anomalies around Earth�s Lunar orbit.

Enter Barbara �Bobbi� Morse, AKA Mockingbird, the latest recruit to the Agents of Wakanda, who helped them out of their strange situation. Eventually they figured out the vine creature�s name was Entea and she fed off the energy of the moon. Since the moon has nothing to survive on, she starved, until Man-Wolf shared some of his star gem�s energy with her. But it wasn�t enough, so he decided to open a portal to Other Realm, the universe at his command as Stargod, a role he gained previously.\\n\\nWhen they arrived, it�s desolate and destroyed. While Man-Wolf felt regret, like he failed the people of Other Realm, T�Challa reminded him of the complexities of the situation, and that being all things to all people is a responsibility to shoulder and he must decide if he�s willing to do it. Entea then decided to move to Other Realm, to feed and germinate at the same time, as Man-Wolf chose to stay as well and look for other signs of life.

Together with a newly arrived Yondu and his fellow Guardians, Quill devised a plan to distract his father while the team planted a bomb on Ego�s brain, deep within the planet they stood upon.\\n\\nThe plan worked and Ego was defeated, but in the process Yondu sacrificed his life to save Peter Quill and his friends, awakening Star-Lord to the realization that the Ravager leader acted as a real father to him, not the cosmic being that had tried to manipulate and use him. Star-Lord arranged for a proper funeral for Yondu, with full honors. In the time that followed, the baby incarnation of Groot began to age and grow. Having taken on a fatherly role with Groot, Quill was exasperated to learn that his charge was now at the temperament one might expect to find in a typical adolescent, complete with a healthy disrespect for Quill�s authority.\\n\\n',\n",

When Quill, Gamora, and Drax left with Quill�s long-lost father, Ego, Rocket and Groot stayed behind for Rocket to fix the ship. They encountered Yondu Udonta�s Ravagers, who took the duo onto their ship and into captivity, while locking Yondu himself up following a mutiny. Abused by the crew, the little Groot, assisted by remorseful Ravager Kraglin, helped Rocket and Yondu escape to return to the company of their friends on Ego�s world.\\n\\nWith Ego revealed as not only having been responsible for the death of Quill�s mother, but to have a terrifying �expansion� planned, which would turn the entire universe into an extension of himself, Rocket designed a bomb intended to blow up Ego�s consciousness at the core of the planet. While his friends fought both Ego and the returning Sovereign, Groot was tasked with delivering the explosive package to the core, a mission he readily accepted and, overcoming many questions about his ability to correctly remember what to do, carried out with success. Upon reaching the surface again, he learned of Yondu�s noble sacrifice to save Quill and later witnessed his moving funeral.

His longest companion is James Buchanan �Bucky� Barnes, who Rogers met in his Hell�s Kitchen neighborhood in New York and formed a close friendship with. Despite Barnes� enlistment in the Army and Rogers� career as Captain America during the war, the two found each other and united to form a solid battlefront against the Axis. When Barnes seemingly fell to his death, Steve Rogers felt as if a brother had been taken from him.Though his time with Peggy Carter was comparatively short to his friendship with Bucky Barnes, Rogers� feelings toward the capable young woman had begun to blossom into romance before his crash into the Atlantic. The two reunited in the present day, but Carter�s advanced age and her weakening health prevented them from continuing what they�d begun during the war.

And it was not only from the soldiers he fought alongside, but also from British secret agent Peggy Carter, an expert on Hydra, who had served as Erskine�s assistant on the Super-Soldier program. After a series of battles overseas, Rogers, Barnes, and the Howling Commandos strike force staged an assault on a train carrying Hydra personnel, during which Barnes seemingly fell to his death. Grieving over the loss, Rogers nevertheless continued his campaign against Hydra, while also growing closer to Peggy.Captain America took the fight directly to the Red Skull when he led an invasion of the villain�s base in an all-out attempt to break Hydra�s hold on the war. Rogers successfully boarded the Skull�s aircraft as it took off to launch an attack on the United States. But, when his foe�s powerful Tesseract energy source spelled the Red Skull�s doom, the Super-Soldier found himself with no other alternative then to purposefully crash the plane to stop its pre-programmed drive toward America. While Peggy Carter listened through radio communications with the aircraft, Steve Rogers took it down into the icy North Atlantic waters and apparently to his death.Instead, Captain America entered into a state of suspended animation after the crash, and was recovered in the present day by S.H.I.E.L.D., the successor to Peggy Carter�s Strategic Scientific Reserve. Awakened, he learned of his current status and began the long journey to acclimating to a brand-new, modern world.\\n\\nAlmost immediately upon Steve Roger�s revival in the present, he was offered a spot in Nick Fury�s Avengers Initiative and took his place among other heroes, including Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk.

Loki was defeated. While the Avengers parted ways for the time being, the group had developed mutual respect for one another, as well as the desire to maintain the team when they were needed to address larger threats.\\n\\nAfter filming a series of Public Service Announcements on different subjects for high school students, Captain America continued to acclimate to modern times and forged friendships with fellow Avenger Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow and a USAF operative named Sam Wilson. Rogers was spending much of his time assisting S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field.\\n\\nBoth Romanoff and Wilson aided him when it was discovered that Hydra had long ago infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Rogers was on the run after an attempt to silence him. Rogers found another ally in Sharon Carter, an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent he would later learn was Peggy Carter�s great niece. At this time, Rogers also discovered his old friend Bucky Barnes had not in fact died during World War II, but became a brainwashed sleeper agent and assassin for Hydra called the Winter Soldier. In the midst of stopping Hydra�s nefarious �Project Insight� program, Cap and Bucky battled, and Cap�s pleas to his old friend to remember who he was finally seemed to succeed, as Bucky saved Rogers from drowning, though he vanished in the aftermath. Re-teaming with the Avengers to take out remaining Hydra cells brought Roger�s into contact with the enhanced siblings Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, as the Avengers retrieved the powerful staff Loki had used in his attempt to conquer Earth. After Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the staff to help create a free-thinking robot called Ultron, only for Ultron to turn on humanity, Rogers took Stark to task over the situation, setting off a deep-seated disagreement between the two men. The Avengers, now joined by a regretful Wanda and Pietro, faced off with Ultron in the small nation of Sokovia, and although they defeated the robot, they failed to prevent the loss of Pietro or the devastation of the Sokovian people and their community.Leading a new lineup of the Avengers, Captain America continued his work to fight criminals around the globe. But, when several innocents died during a confrontation with Cap�s enemy, Brock Rumlow, it set off a chain reaction that resulted in a United Nations-backed program called the Sokovia Accords, which would be used to register and control the actions of super humans and costumed champions. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark grappled with opposite opinions on the matter, with Rogers firmly against the concept of the Accords, which in turn led to the Avengers and various other heroes taking sides in the growing conflict. In the midst of this, Steve also had to deal with the death of the now-elderly Peggy Carter and was reunited with Sharon, who once again covertly helped him, while the two took tentative steps towards a romance.\\n\\nDuring these events, Bucky also resurfaced after a lethal bomb was set off during a United Nation gathering over the Accords and the Winter Soldier was framed for the horrific act. The victims of that bombing included Wakanda's king, T�Chaka, leading his son, Prince T�Challa, the Black Panther, to seek revenge against Barnes. Inevitably, the tensions between Cap and his friends and their former teammates turned physical, with T�Challa among those fighting with Stark, as Rogers strove to protect Barnes and find the real culprit.\",\n",

However, the situation escalated again when Stark, as part of Zemo�s insidious plan to destroy the Avengers, learned that it was Barnes who had killed his parents years before and that Rogers had kept the information from him. In a bitter fight between Iron Man and Captain America, Rogers managed to eventually subdue Stark and walked away from the Avengers completely, leaving his shield behind.

After he discovered Stane had illegally sold Stark weapons to the Ten Rings, he donned the armor to return to Afghanistan and stop the group from using them. Later, he also learned that Stane had paid the Ten Rings to kill him and had been working behind Stark�s back to steal the entire company.

But, Potts helped Stark insert his original, cobbled-together RT into his chest, and Iron Man flew again.\\n\\nStane presented himself in a gigantic suit of armor of his own, and a battle ensued until Stark and Potts overloaded Stane�s power source and Stane died in the process. Feeling more confident in himself than ever before, Stark called a press conference soon after the fight and impulsively announced to the world that he was indeed Iron Man.\\n\\n',\n",

At first a large piece of equipment, the younger Stark miniaturized the technology into the �RT,� which was the size of a human heart, and put it to great use to power his suits of armor. Iron Man�s armor provided a complete working environment for its user, including enhanced strength, closed air systems, data input, communications, flight, defense systems, and offensive weaponry such as missiles, lasers, and so-called �repulsor� technology. Stark never stops in his advancement of his armor designs, and at one time created multiple versions, each one of them with a specialized use. The armor has also become lighter and more flexible since the first incarnation, allowing Stark to �suit up� in mere seconds and be immediately ready for action.\\n\\nStark�s latest suit was destroyed in battle with the tyrant Thanos, but while in use sported maximum thrust for flight, new offensive weapons, and nanotechnology that allowed near instantaneous application.',\n",

The green behemoth possesses the greatest raw strength of any natural being on Earth, with an upper limit that has yet to be fully tested. His leg muscles allow him to leap great distances and land without harm, and his skin can resist damage from heavy weaponry, as well as the natural elements and even unnatural ones.\\n\\nThe Hulk has grown somewhat more intelligent over the years, beginning with the mind of nearly an infant and progressing to what might be described as the personality of a toddler. His speech has increased from growls and roars, to one or two words at a time, to full sentences, albeit broken and na�ve. Banner recognizes the Hulk as himself, but often refers to him as �the other guy,� while his alter-ego seems to have little love or respect for the mild scientist and may not even be cognizant that Banner is himself.The doctor transforms into the Hulk during moments of stress, anxiety, and most of all anger. The change can reverse itself if the Hulk reaches a state of calm, either by himself or through a special mantra utilized by his fellow Avengers, most notably Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow.',\n",

After becoming the Hulk, he seemed to maintain his memory and knowledge of the relationship and gravitated toward Betty to protect her from harm. After the Hulk�s first real battle with another creature nearly as strong as himself, he was prevented from killing his foe by Betty and fled the area without her, which seems to have been the last time they were in contact.\\n\\nAfter allying himself with the Avengers, Banner entered into a complex romantic relationship with Natasha Romanoff, the master spy called the Black Widow. At first, Banner resisted his feelings for Romanoff, citing his inability to live a normal life as a reason to maintain a platonic partnership with her. The Black Widow convinced him otherwise and for a brief moment it seemed the two might find happiness together, before the Hulk decided to leave, likely reflecting Banner�s own concerns.\\n\\nBoth Banner and the Hulk have witnessed a friendship flourish with the Asgardian Thor, a fellow Avenger. At first, the two struggled through violent clashes and petty arguments over who was the strongest, but these contests led to camaraderie during their time as enslaved gladiators on the planet Sakaar. In Thor, the Hulk may have finally found his truest companion.Tony Stark has also reached out to Bruce Banner as a peer in the realm of science, and as a man who suffers from a debilitation much like he himself once did. Together, the two have worked together on projects seemingly as one mind, though Banner has raised objections to what he feels are moral and ethical gaps in Stark�s push to advance technology.',\n",

During this time, he communicated with cellular biologist Doctor Samuel Sterns back in the U.S., but the unintended transportation of Banner�s irradiated blood to a man in Milwaukee exposed his whereabouts to �Thunderbolt� Ross and his operative, Emil Blonsky. Banner reentered the country to try and recover his original research data from Culver University, but that meant the Hulk came with him and not even a reunion with Betty Ross could quell the angered beast.\\n\\nAfter making his way first to Smoky Mountains National Forest and then the steel canyons of New York, Bruce Banner was forced to pit his alter-ego against a gamma-transformed Blonsky, the duplicity of Dr. Sterns, and the ever-looming �Thunderbolt� Ross. The Hulk defeated Blonsky and moved in for the kill, but Betty Ross stopped him from crossing this line and he fled once again. Soon after, in seclusion, Banner began to try and gain more control over the Hulk.\\n\\nSometime later, S.H.I.E.L.D.�s Nick Fury dispatched his operative Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, to approach Banner in India and convince him to join the so-called Avengers Initiative. Unfortunately, the team�s first mission, to prevent Loki�s despoiling of the planet with the mystical Tesseract device, brought the Hulk and his other potential teammates into the trickster�s crosshairs, resulting in a furious battle onboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier between Hulk and Thor. During that fight, the Hulk crashed down to Earth and transformed back into Banner, and then made his way back to New York. Explaining to his fellow Avengers that he was in fact always, on some level, angry, he was able to consciously transform into the Hulk to assist the Avengers in their fight against aliens brought to Earth by Loki�s machinations, and the would-be conquerors were ultimately defeated.',\n",

There he found what seemed a fitting place for a being such as himself�as a fighter in the Grandmaster�s gladiator arena. Besting all others in battle, he soon became the Grandmaster�s beloved champion and remained the Hulk at all times, never changing back into Bruce Banner. When his fellow Avenger Thor arrived on the planet and was forced into the arena as well, the Hulk was pitted against him. The fight that ensued ended somewhat indecisively for the satisfaction of either. In the aftermath of their fight, the Hulk, while bonding more with Thor, initially didn�t want to help his fellow Avenger in his plan to escape. When the Hulk attempted to stop Thor from using the Avengers Quinjet to leave Sakaar, a recording of Romanoff onboard made the creature transform back into Banner for the first time in two years.\\n\\nThe Hulk had damaged the Quinjet beyond repair. So, Thor, aided by Loki, found another ship to leave Sakaar and return to his native Asgard to reclaim the throne from his older sister Hela, with Banner and the warrior Valkyrie accompanying him. Overcoming his concerns that transforming back into the Hulk could result in never returning to his human form, Banner chose to allow his alter-ego to resurface after Hela unleashed her giant wolf, Fenris, against the surviving Asgardians. As the Hulk, he defeated the huge animal. In the meantime, Thor put an end to Hela, albeit at the cost of Asgard itself. Upon Asgard�s destruction, the Hulk�still having not changed back into Banner�joined the remaining Asgardians on a space ship launched into the cosmos to find a new home.

He respects and takes orders from Nick Fury (unless they contradict his own sense of what is right) and supports colleagues like Maria Hill and Phil Coulson.\\n\\nHis closest friendship is with Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, who he recruits for S.H.I.E.L.D. They often work together on missions and have a strong rapport. Natasha has been known to wear an arrow necklace in honor of her friend, and even bargains for his release when he is under Loki�s control. He cannot bring himself to fight her properly when they are on opposing sides of the Sokovia Accord dispute. She is also the only agent apart from Nick Fury that he entrusts with knowledge of his family (until he brings the Avengers to his compound). When Director Fury put the Avengers initiative in place, Barton fights alongside the likes of Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and eventually, Ant-Man, Vision, Falcon, War Machine and other heroes. He forms a close bond with the Maximoff twins, acting as a mentor when they switch sides to face against Ultron. He mentors Scarlet Witch, encouraging her to face her fears and become and Avenger. Pietro Maximoff, AKA Quicksilver, even gives his life to save Hawkeye.\\n\\nMost important to him, however, are his wife Laura and kids Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel (whose middle name �Pietro� reflects the hero�s sacrifice).',\n",

These traits impress Thor from the moment he meets the young scientist, and their admiration for each other quickly grows into love. Whenever Thor is away from Earth, he counts the minutes until he returns to Jane Foster�s side. Unfortunately, the two part ways eventually.

In doing so, she becomes yet another staunch ally of the thunder god�s, as does the Kronan named Korg, who also fights with Thor on both Sakaar and Asgard. While Thor encounters all of the Guardians of the Galaxy, he forges a special bond with Rocket, who accompanies him on his journey to create Stormbreaker in order to battle Thanos.

After a harrowing experience at the Washington Monument with a Chitauri explosive, Parker returned to New York and tracked the Vulture to a deal on the Staten Island Ferry. Iron Man jetted in to help when the ensuing fight threatened to sink the ferry and kill those onboard; later Stark warned Parker again, in no uncertain terms, that his career as a Super Hero was over. To ensure Parker took him seriously, he also took back the Spider-Man suit.',\n",

The night of the dance, he learned that Liz�s father is Adrian Toomes, the Vulture, and in turn, Toomes learned that he was Spider-Man. Toomes warned Parker to stay away, but the young man, wearing his original homemade Spider-Man costume, stubbornly refused to give up and battled his foe all the way into the air and on top of a plane carrying Stark weapons the Vulture attempted to hijack.\\n\\nUpon defeating his adversary, Spider-Man left him for the police and prepared to face Tony Stark�s wrath. Instead, impressed by the growth he had seen, Stark commended him for his victory, and offered Parker a new, upgraded Spider-Man suit and full Avengers membership. However, Peter had reevaluated how quickly he was trying to raise his status and politely declined Stark�s offer, deciding to stay a local hero for the time being. Returning home, he discovered Stark had returned the suit he�d taken back from him earlier, and Peter donned it again, only to be stumbled upon by May.\\n\\nWhen Thanos� followers came to Earth to acquire the Infinity Stones harbored there, Spider-Man aided Iron Man and Doctor Strange in confronting the powerful being. Wanting to try to save Strange when he was abducted by the aliens, he stubbornly disobeyed Stark�s orders to stay behind and hitched a ride on the departing starship�ultimately given an assist by the upgraded, armored suit Stark had made for him that he�d once turned down while declining Avengers membership.',\n",

The plan failed and the tyrant left Titan with the Stone, going on to gain the sixth and final Infinity Stone on Earth. Having done so, with a snap of his fingers, Thanos caused half of all life throughout the Universe to end. On Titan, those affected included Peter Parker, who could feel something was happening to him.
